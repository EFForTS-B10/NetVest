Main question: How do price differences drive certain aspects of the households in the landscape


```{r corplot, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Correlations plot"}
knitr::include_graphics("../../03_Analyses/04_testing_Refforts/prices_ff_correlations.png")

```

Correlations are displayed in Figure \@ref(fig:corplot)
