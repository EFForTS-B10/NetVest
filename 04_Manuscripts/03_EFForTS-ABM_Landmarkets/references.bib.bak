abstract = {Many ecosystem functions depend on the structure of food webs, which heavily relies on the body size spectrum of the community. Despite that, little is known on how the size spectrum of soil animals responds to agricultural practices in tropical land-use systems and how these responses affect ecosystem functioning. We studied land-use-induced changes in below-ground communities in tropical lowland ecosystems in Sumatra (Jambi province, Indonesia), a hot spot of tropical rainforest conversion into rubber and oil palm plantations. The study included ca. 30,000 measured individuals from 33 high-order taxa of meso- and macrofauna spanning eight orders of magnitude in body mass. Using individual body masses, we calculated the metabolism of trophic guilds and used food web models to calculate energy fluxes and infer ecosystem functions, such as decomposition, herbivory, primary and intraguild predation. Land-use change was associated with reduced abundance and taxonomic diversity of soil invertebrates, but strong increase in total biomass and moderate changes in total energy flux. These changes were due to increased biomass of large-sized decomposers in soil, in particular earthworms, with their share in community metabolism increasing from 11{\%} in rainforest to 59{\%}–76{\%} in jungle rubber, and rubber and oil palm plantations. Decomposition, that is the energy flux to decomposers, stayed unchanged, but herbivory, primary and intraguild predation decreased by an order of magnitude in plantation systems. Intraguild predation was very important, being responsible for 38{\%} of the energy flux in rainforest according to our model. Conversion of rainforest into monoculture plantations is associated by an uneven loss of size classes and trophic levels of soil invertebrates resulting in sequestration of energy in large-sized primary consumers and restricted flux of energy to higher trophic levels. Pronounced differences between rainforest and jungle rubber reflect sensitivity of rainforest soil animal communities to moderate land-use changes. Soil communities in plantation systems sustained high total energy flux despite reduced biodiversity. The high energy flux into large decomposers but low energy fluxes into other trophic guilds suggests that trophic multifunctionality of below-ground communities is compromised in plantation systems.},

abstract = {Oil palm and rubber expansion is a main driver of the widespread deforestation of tropical rainforests taking place in South-East Asia, particularly in Indonesia. The replacement of forests with monoculture plantations of rubber and oil palm reduces biodiversity and carbon pools but also modifies canopy structure, which is an important determinant of microclimate. There is, however, a lack of quantitative information characterizing the effect of such land transformation on microclimate. We report the first medium-term observations of below-canopy microclimatic conditions (air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit and soil temperature) across forest, jungle rubber agroforest, oil palm and rubber monoculture plantations in Sumatra/Indonesia. The data set covers a period of approximately three years (2013–2016) and includes one of the strongest El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillations (ENSO) of the last decades. Forests were up to 2.3 and 2.2 °C cooler than oil palm and rubber monocultures respectively. The monocultures were also drier (11.9{\%} and 12.8{\%} less in oil palm and rubber respectively) and had higher vapour pressure deficit (632 Pa and 665 Pa higher in oil palm and rubber respectively) than the forest, while differences in soil temperature were less pronounced. Conversion from forest to other land uses, especially to monocultures, also amplified the diurnal range of all microclimatic variables studied. Jungle rubber stands out as the transformed land-use system that maintains more stable microclimatic conditions. Our results indicate that canopy openness is a key driver of below-canopy microclimate, and hence could be used in climate models to better evaluate climatic feedbacks of land-use change to rubber and oil palm. The ENSO event of 2015 led to warmer and drier conditions than in the previous two years in all four land-use systems, especially in the forest (up to 2.3 °C warmer, 8.9{\%} drier and up to 351 Pa more during ENSO). The relative effect of ENSO was lower in the monoculture plantations, where below-canopy microclimate is generally more similar to open areas. Forests exhibited the largest differences with the pre-ENSO years, but still maintained more stable microclimatic conditions (lower temperatures and vapour pressure deficit and higher relative humidity) due to their higher climate regulation capacity. During ENSO, microclimatic conditions in jungle rubber were comparable to those in the monocultures, suggesting that while forests buffered the increase of temperature, jungle rubber might have surpassed its buffering capacity to extreme events. This capacity of buffering extreme climatic events should be considered when assessing the effects of land-use change.},

abstract = {Motivation: The Illumina paired-end sequencing technology can generate reads from both ends of target DNA fragments, which can subsequently be merged to increase the overall read length. There already exist tools for merging these paired-end reads when the target fragments are equally long. However, when fragment lengths vary and, in particular, when either the fragment size is shorter than a single-end read, or longer than twice the size of a single-end read, most state-of-the-art mergers fail to generate reliable results. Therefore, a robust tool is needed to merge paired-end reads that exhibit varying overlap lengths because of varying target fragment lengths.Results: We present the PEAR software for merging raw Illumina paired-end reads from target fragments of varying length. The program evaluates all possible paired-end read overlaps and does not require the target fragment size as input. It also implements a statistical test for minimizing false-positive results. Tests on simulated and empirical data show that PEAR consistently generates highly accurate merged paired-end reads. A highly optimized implementation allows for merging millions of paired-end reads within a few minutes on a standard desktop computer. On multi-core architectures, the parallel version of PEAR shows linear speedups compared with the sequential version of PEAR.Availability and implementation: PEAR is implemented in C and uses POSIX threads.

abstract = {Background: We present the Biological Observation Matrix (BIOM, pronounced " biome" ) format: a JSON-based file format for representing arbitrary observation by sample contingency tables with associated sample and observation metadata. As the number of categories of comparative omics data types (collectively, the " ome-ome" ) grows rapidly, a general format to represent and archive this data will facilitate the interoperability of existing bioinformatics tools and future meta-analyses.Findings: The BIOM file format is supported by an independent open-source software project (the biom-format project), which initially contains Python objects that support the use and manipulation of BIOM data in Python programs, and is intended to be an open development effort where developers can submit implementations of these objects in other programming languages.Conclusions: The BIOM file format and the biom-format project are steps toward reducing the " bioinformatics bottleneck" that is currently being experienced in diverse areas of biological sciences, and will help us move toward the next phase of comparative omics where basic science is translated into clinical and environmental applications. The BIOM file format is currently recognized as an Earth Microbiome Project Standard, and as a Candidate Standard by the Genomic Standards Consortium. {\textcopyright} 2012 2012 McDonald et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Undetected chimeras may be misinterpreted as novel species, causing inflated estimates of diversity and spurious inferences of differences between populations. Detection and removal of chimeras is therefore of critical importance in such experiments. Results: We describe UCHIME, a new program that detects chimeric sequences with two or more segments. UCHIME either uses a database of chimera-free sequences or detects chimeras de novo by exploiting abundance data. UCHIME has better sensitivity than ChimeraSlayer (previously the most sensitive database method), especially with short, noisy sequences. In testing on artificial bacterial communities with known composition, UCHIME de novo sensitivity is shown to be comparable to Perseus.

We hypothesized that increasing land use intensity and habitat loss due to the replacement of the hyperdiverse forest flora by nonendemic cash crops drives a drastic loss of diversity of soil fungal taxa and impairs the ecological soil functions. Unexpectedly, rain forest conversion was not associated with strong diversity loss but with massive shifts in soil fungal community composition. Fungal communities clustered according to land use system and loss of plant species. Network analysis revealed characteristic fungal genera significantly associated with different land use systems. Shifts in soil fungal community structure were particularly distinct among different trophic groups, with substantial decreases in symbiotrophic fungi and increases in saprotrophic and pathotrophic fungi in oil palm and rubber plantations in comparison with rain forests. In conclusion, conversion of rain forests and current land use systems restructure soil fungal communities towards enhanced pathogen pressure and, thus, threaten ecosystem health functions.},

abstract = {If current trends continue, the tropical forests of the Anthropocene will be much smaller, simpler, steeper and emptier than they are today. They will be more diminished in size and heavily fragmented (especially in lowland wet forests), have reduced structural and species complexity, be increasingly restricted to steeper, less accessible areas, and be missing many heavily hunted species. These changes, in turn, will greatly reduce the quality and quantity of ecosystem services that tropical forests can provide. Driving these changes will be continued clearance for farming and monoculture forest plantations, unsustainable selective logging, overhunting, and, increasingly, climate change. Concerted action by local and indigenous communities, environmental groups, governments, and corporations can reverse these trends and, if successful, provide future generations with a tropical forest estate that includes a network of primary forest reserves robustly defended from threats, recovering logged and secondary forests, and resilient community forests managed for the needs of local people. Realizing this better future for tropical forests and people will require formalisation of land tenure for local and indigenous communities, better-enforced environmental laws, the widescale roll-out of payments for ecosystem service schemes, and sustainable intensification of under-yielding farmland, as well as global-scale societal changes, including reduced consumerism, meat consumption, fossil fuel reliance, and population growth.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract. Expansion of palm oil and rubber production, for which global demand is increasing, causes rapid deforestation in Sumatra, Indonesia, and is expected to continue in the next decades. Our study aimed to (1) quantify changes in soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes with land-use change and (2) determine their controlling factors. In Jambi Province, Sumatra, we selected two landscapes on heavily weathered soils that differ mainly in texture: loam and clay Acrisol soils. In each landscape, we investigated the reference land-use types (forest and secondary forest with regenerating rubber) and the converted land-use types (rubber, 7–17 years old, and oil palm plantations, 9–16 years old). We measured soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes monthly from December 2012 to December 2013. Annual soil CO2 fluxes from the reference land-use types were correlated with soil fertility: low extractable phosphorus (P) coincided with high annual CO2 fluxes from the loam Acrisol soil that had lower fertility than the clay Acrisol soil (P {\textless} 0.05). Soil CO2 fluxes from the oil palm (107.2 to 115.7 mg C m−2 h−1) decreased compared to the other land-use types (between 178.7 and 195.9 mg C m−2 h−1; P {\textless} 0.01). Across land-use types, annual CO2 fluxes were positively correlated with soil organic carbon (C) and negatively correlated with 15N signatures, extractable P and base saturation. This suggests that the reduced soil CO2 fluxes from oil palm were the result of strongly decomposed soil organic matter and reduced soil C stocks due to reduced litter input as well as being due to a possible reduction in C allocation to roots due to improved soil fertility from liming and P fertilization in these plantations. Soil CH4 uptake in the reference land-use types was negatively correlated with net nitrogen (N) mineralization and soil mineral N, suggesting N limitation of CH4 uptake, and positively correlated with exchangeable aluminum (Al), indicating a decrease in methanotrophic activity at high Al saturation. Reduction in soil CH4 uptake in the converted land-use types (ranging from −3.0 to −14.9 $\mu$g C m−2 h−1) compared to the reference land-use types (ranging from −20.8 to −40.3 $\mu$g C m−2 h−1; P {\textless} 0.01) was due to a decrease in soil N availability in the converted land-use types. Our study shows for the first time that differences in soil fertility control the soil–atmosphere exchange of CO2 and CH4 in a tropical landscape, a mechanism that we were able to detect by conducting this study on the landscape scale.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Forest conversion to agriculture can decrease soil nutrient stocks overtime. However, inherent spatial variability in soil biochemical properties in converted landscapes could be high, and may supersede effects of land-use change on soil nutrient changes. Our aims were to assess changes in soil nutrient stocks with land-use change, and to quantify the proportions of spatial variability and land-use change effects on the overall variance of soil nutrient stocks. This study was conducted in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia in two distinct landscapes defined by the dominant soil texture and type: loam and clay Acrisol soils. In each landscape, four land-use types were examined: lowland forest and rubber interspersed in naturally regenerating forest (referred here as “jungle rubber”) as reference land uses and smallholder plantations of rubber and oil palm. In the 0–0.5 m soil depth of the reference land uses, the clay Acrisol had higher total N (660.1 ± 63.8–1074.2 ± 158.8 g N m− 2; P ≤ 0.05), exchangeable Ca (24.1 ± 5.7–80.6 ± 22.8 g Ca m− 2; P ≤ 0.06), Mg (4.3 ± 0.6–39.2 ± 16.3 g Mg m− 2; P ≤ 0.02), K (11.7 ± 0.7–34.7 ± 12.1 g K m− 2; P ≤ 0.06), extractable P (1.1 ± 0.1–2.6 ± 0.1 g P m− 2; P ≤ 0.001) and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC; 11.4 ± 3.1–40.6 ± 11.0 cmolc kg− 1; P = 0.02), illustrating that clay content influenced soil fertility in these highly weathered soils. Compared to the reference land uses, the oil palm plantations had higher soil pH (4.2 ± 0.0–4.6 ± 0.1; P ≤ 0.04), base saturation (8.9 ± 1.6–6.5 ± 1.3{\%}; P ≤ 0.07) and extractable P (0.8 ± 0.1–6.1 ± 3.2 g P m− 2; P ≤ 0.01) in the top 0.5 m depth, which was probably due to the legacy effect of biomass burning and fertilization. We were unable to detect significant effects of land-use change on other soil biochemical characteristics (i.e., ECEC, stocks of exchangeable bases, soil organic carbon (SOC), total N). Based on variance components analysis, a large proportion of the variance of these parameters was accounted by the variation among replicate plots (26–91{\%}) rather than by land-use types (only 0–6{\%}). Power analysis showed that the optimum number of replicate plots to detect land-use change effects on these parameters ranged from 5 to 7. Our results suggest that spatial variability must be represented in the experimental design in order to detect land-use change effects on soil nutrient changes through stratifying the area of inference (i.e., landscape or region) based on known drivers of soil fertility and determining the optimal number of experimental units.},

abstract = {Oil palm is one of the most extensively cultivated biodiesel feedstocks worldwide, and expansion of its cultivation poses a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity and potentially the global climate. We evaluate the prospects of land sparing and wildlife-friendly farming, two contrasting approaches for reducing the impacts of oil palm agriculture. We draw on concepts from both approaches to suggest more sustainable production systems and argue that landscapes under threat from oil palm expansion need to be designed in recognition of biodiversity, economic and livelihood needs. Specifically, we advocate agroforestry zones between high conservation value areas and intensive oil palm plantations to create a more heterogeneous landscape benefiting both biodiversity and rural communities.

abstract = {* The compositional complexity of an assemblage is not expressible as a single number; standard measures such as diversities (Hill numbers) and entropies (R{\'{e}}nyi entropies and Tsallis entropies) vary in their order q which determines the measures' emphasis on rare or common species. Ranking and comparing assemblages depend on the choice of q. Rather than selecting one or a few measures to describe an assemblage, it is preferable to convey the complete story by presenting a continuous profile, a plot of diversity or entropy as a function of q ≥ 0. This makes it easy to visually compare the compositional complexities of multiple assemblages and to judge the evenness of the relative abundance distributions of the assemblages. In practice, the profile is plotted for all values of q from 0 to q = 3 or 4 (beyond which it generally changes little). * These profiles are usually generated by substituting species sample proportions into the complexity measures. However, this empirical approach typically underestimates the true profile for low values of q, because samples usually miss some of the assemblage's species due to under-sampling. Although bias-reduction methods exist for individual measures of order q = 0, 1 and 2, there has been no analytic method that unifies these bias-corrected estimates into a continuous profile. * For incomplete sampling data, this work proposes a novel analytic method to obtain accurate, continuous, low-bias diversity and entropy profiles with focus on low orders of q (0 ≤ q ≤ 3). Our approach is based on reformulating the diversity and entropy of any order q in terms of the successive discovery rates of new species with respect to sample size, that is the successive slopes of the species accumulation curve. A bootstrap method is applied to obtain approximate variances of our proposed profiles and to construct the associated confidence intervals. * Extensive simulations from theoretical models and real surveys show that the proposed profiles greatly reduce under-sampling bias and have substantially lower bias and mean-squared error than the empirical profile, especially for q ≤ 1. Our method is also extended to deal with incidence data.},

abstract = {Human-driven land-use changes increasingly threaten biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where both species diversity and human pressures on natural environments are high. The rapid conversion of tropical forests for agriculture, timber production and other uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially dire consequences for tropical biodiversity. Today, few truly undisturbed tropical forests exist, whereas those degraded by repeated logging and fires, as well as secondary and plantation forests, are rapidly expanding. Here we provide a global assessment of the impact of disturbance and land conversion on biodiversity in tropical forests using a meta-analysis of 138 studies. We analysed 2,220 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity values in primary forests (with little or no human disturbance) and disturbed forests. We found that biodiversity values were substantially lower in degraded forests, but that this varied considerably by geographic region, taxonomic group, ecological metric and disturbance type. Even after partly accounting for confounding colonization and succession effects due to the composition of surrounding habitats, isolation and time since disturbance, we find that most forms of forest degradation have an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on tropical biodiversity. Our results clearly indicate that when it comes to maintaining tropical biodiversity, there is no substitute for primary forests. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We highlight here the crucial role of $\beta$-diversity – a hitherto underexplored facet of biodiversity – for a better process-level understanding of biodiversity change and its consequences for ecosystems. A focus on $\beta$-diversity has the potential to improve predictions of natural and anthropogenic influences on diversity and ecosystem functioning. However, linking the causes and consequences of biodiversity change is complex because species assemblages in nature are shaped by many factors simultaneously, including disturbance, environmental heterogeneity, deterministic niche factors, and stochasticity. Because variability and change are ubiquitous in ecosystems, acknowledging these inherent properties of nature is an essential step for further advancing scientific knowledge of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning in theory and practice.},

abstract = {Aim Anthropogenic changes in land use may have major consequences for global biodiversity. However, species diversity is determined by a suite of factors that may affect species differently at different spatial scales. We tested the combined effects of land use and spatial scale on alpha, beta and gamma diversity in the tropics using experimental communities of cavity-nesting bees and waSPS (Hymenoptera: Aculeata). We aimed to determine whether: (1) land-use intensity negatively affects species richness of cavity-nesting Hymenoptera, (2) beta diversity, both within and between plots, is higher in more natural systems, (3) species richness of flowering herbs correlates positively with species richness of Hymenoptera within and across habitats, (4) richness of cavity-nesting Hymenoptera in highly modified habitats declines with increasing distance from natural or semi-natural habitats, (5) the effects of land use, herb diversity and forest distance on Hymenoptera alpha and beta diversity vary at different spatial scales, and (6) bees and waSPS respond to land use in a similar way. Location Manabi, south-west Ecuador. Methods We examined diversity (species richness) within 48 plots of five habitat types that comprised a gradient of decreasing agricultural intensity from rice and pasture to coffee agroforests, unmanaged abandoned agroforests and forest fragments, using standardized nesting resources for reproducing communities of cavity-nesting bees and waSPS. Results (1) Land use significantly affected alpha diversity of trap-nesting bees and waSPS at the subplot (per trap) scale, but not subplot beta diversity or plot-scale species richness (gamma diversity). (2) Beta diversity was surprisingly higher between plots within a land-use type than between land-use types. (3) Species richness of bees and waSPS increased with diversity of flowering herbs at the subplot (trap) scale only. (4) Forest distance correlated positively with bee species richness at the plot scale only. (5) Land use, herb diversity and forest distance each showed significant correlations with bee and wasp diversity at only one spatial scale. (6) Despite differences in life history, bees and waSPS responded to land-use intensity in a similar way. Main conclusions The effects of land use on species richness were highly dependent on spatial scale. Subplot-scale analyses showed that rice and pasture contained the highest species diversity, whereas plot-scale analyses showed no significant difference in the diversity of different land-use types. We emphasize caution in the estimation of biodiversity at only one spatial scale, and highlight the surprisingly large contribution of managed land to the regional biodiversity of these species.},

We test whether the replacement components derived from the BAS and POD frameworks are independent of richness difference. We also evaluate whether previously reported tests of monotonicity between indices and ecological processes are informative to assess the performance of indices. Finally, we illustrate the consequences of differences between the BAS and POD frameworks using the North American freshwater fish fauna as an empirical example. 3.In the BAS framework, the nestedness-resultant component ($\beta$jne or $\beta$sne) accounts only for richness differences derived from nested patterns while, in the POD framework, richness-difference dissimilarity ($\beta$rich or $\beta$rich.s) accounts for all kind of richness differences. Likewise, the replacement components of both alternative methods account for different concepts. Only the replacement component of the BAS framework ($\beta$jtu or $\beta$sim) is independent of richness difference, while the parallel component in the POD framework ($\beta$-3 or $\beta$-3.s) is not (i.e. it is mathematically constrained by richness difference). 4.Therefore, only the BAS framework allows separating (i) the variation in species composition derived from species replacement which is independent of richness difference (i.e. not mathematically constrained by it) and (ii) the variation in species composition derived from nested patterns.

abstract = {* Beta diversity is a conceptual link between diversity at local and regional scales. Various additional methodologies of quantifying this and related phenomena have been applied. Among them, measures of pairwise (dis)similarity of sites are particularly popular. Undersampling, i.e. not recording all taxa present at a site, is a common situation in ecological data. Bias in many metrics related to beta diversity must be expected, but only few studies have explicitly investigated the properties of various measures under undersampling conditions. * On the basis of an empirical data set, representing near-complete local inventories of the Lepidoptera from an isolated Pacific island, as well as simulated communities with varying properties, we mimicked different levels of undersampling. We used 14 different approaches to quantify beta diversity, among them dataset-wide multiplicative partitioning (i.e. ‘true beta diversity') and pairwise site x site dissimilarities. We compared their values from incomplete samples to true results from the full data. We used these comparisons to quantify undersampling bias and we calculated correlations of the dissimilarity measures of undersampled data with complete data of sites. * Almost all tested metrics showed bias and low correlations under moderate to severe undersampling conditions (as well as deteriorating precision, i.e. large chance effects on results). Measures that used only species incidence were very sensitive to undersampling, while abundance-based metrics with high dependency on the distribution of the most common taxa were particularly robust. Simulated data showed sensitivity of results to the abundance distribution, confirming that data sets of high evenness and/or the application of metrics that are strongly affected by rare species are particularly sensitive to undersampling. * The class of beta measure to be used should depend on the research question being asked as different metrics can lead to quite different conclusions even without undersampling effects. For each class of metric, there is a trade-off between robustness to undersampling and sensitivity to rare species. In consequence, using incidence-based metrics carries a particular risk of false conclusions when undersampled data are involved. Developing bias corrections for such metrics would be desirable.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Oil palm plantations have expanded rapidly in recent decades. This large-scale land-use change has had great ecological, economic, and social impacts on both the areas converted to oil palm and their surroundings. However, research on the impacts of oil palm cultivation is scattered and patchy, and no clear overview exists. We address this gap through a systematic and comprehensive literature review of all ecosystem functions in oil palm plantations, including several (genetic, medicinal and ornamental resources, information functions) not included in previous systematic reviews. We compare ecosystem functions in oil palm plantations to those in forests, as the conversion of forest to oil palm is prevalent in the tropics. We find that oil palm plantations generally have reduced ecosystem functioning compared to forests: 11 out of 14 ecosystem functions show a net decrease in level of function. Some functions show decreases with potentially irreversible global impacts (e.g. reductions in gas and climate regulation, habitat and nursery functions, genetic resources, medicinal resources, and information functions). The most serious impacts occur when forest is cleared to establish new plantations, and immediately afterwards, especially on peat soils. To variable degrees, specific plantation management measures can prevent or reduce losses of some ecosystem functions (e.g. avoid illegal land clearing via fire, avoid draining of peat, use of integrated pestmanagement, use of cover crops, mulch, and compost) and we highlight synergistic mitigation measures that can improve multiple ecosystem functions simultaneously.

There was notable overlap in the communities of different habitat types, indicating that even intensively managed land can provide a valuable contribution to the overall biodiversity of the landscape mosaic. Importantly, there was a significant effect of habitat type on temporal variation in diversity. While intensive cropping systems such as rice and pasture exhibited higher diversity in certain months, greater species turnover through time in the abandoned coffee and forest plots accounted for the higher overall diversity in these habitats. Overall, spatial and temporal turnover explained 38.6{\%} and 23.1{\%}, respectively, of partitioned regional species richness.

abstract = {Estimating the species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity of a community is challenging because rare species are often undetected, even with intensive sampling. The Good-Turing frequency formula, originally developed for cryptography, estimates in an ecological context the true frequencies of rare species in a single assemblage based on an incomplete sample of individuals. Until now, this formula has never been used to estimate undetected species, phylogenetic, and functional diversity. Here, we first generalize the Good-Turing formula to incomplete sampling of two assemblages. The original formula and its two-assemblage generalization provide a novel and unified approach to notation, terminology, and estimation of undetected biological diversity. For species richness, the Good-Turing framework offers an intuitive way to derive the non-parametric estimators of the undetected species richness in a single assemblage, and of the undetected species shared between two assemblages. For phylogenetic diversity, the unified approach leads to an estimator of the undetected Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PD, the total length of undetected branches of a phylogenetic tree connecting all species), as well as a new estimator of undetected PD shared between two phylogenetic trees. For functional diversity based on species traits, the unified approach yields a new estimator of undetected Walker et al.'s functional attribute diversity (FAD, the total species-pairwise functional distance) in a single assemblage, as well as a new estimator of undetected FAD shared between two assemblages. Although some of the resulting estimators have been previously published (but derived with traditional mathematical inequalities), all taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity estimators are now derived under the same framework. All the derived estimators are theoretically lower bounds of the corresponding undetected diversities; our approach reveals the sufficient conditions under which the estimators are nearly unbiased, thus offering new insights. Simulation results are reported to numerically verify the performance of the derived estimators. We illustrate all estimators and assess their sampling uncertainty with an empirical dataset for Brazilian rain forest trees. These estimators should be widely applicable to many current problems in ecology, such as the effects of climate change on spatial and temporal beta diversity and the contribution of trait diversity to ecosystem multi-functionality.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd. Biological diversity is a key concept in the life sciences and plays a fundamental role in many ecological and evolutionary processes. Although biodiversity is inherently a hierarchical concept covering different levels of organization (genes, population, species, ecological communities and ecosystems), a diversity index that behaves consistently across these different levels has so far been lacking, hindering the development of truly integrative biodiversity studies. To fill this important knowledge gap, we present a unifying framework for the measurement of biodiversity across hierarchical levels of organization. Our weighted, information-based decomposition framework is based on a Hill number of order q = 1, which weights all elements in proportion to their frequency and leads to diversity measures based on Shannon's entropy. We investigated the numerical behaviour of our approach with simulations and showed that it can accurately describe complex spatial hierarchical structures. To demonstrate the intuitive and straightforward interpretation of our diversity measures in terms of effective number of components (alleles, species, etc.), we applied the framework to a real data set on coral reef biodiversity. We expect our framework will have multiple applications covering the fields of conservation biology, community genetics and eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

@article{Latombe2018,
abstract = {Spatial variation in compositional diversity, or species turnover, is necessary for capturing the components of heterogeneity that constitute biodiversity. However, no incidence-based metric of pairwise species turnover can calculate all components of diversity partitioning. Zeta ($\zeta$) diversity, the mean number of species shared by any given number of sites or assemblages, captures all diversity components produced by assemblage partitioning. zetadiv is an R package for analysing and measuring compositional change for occurrence data using zeta diversity. Four types of analyses are performed on bird composition data in Australia: (i) decline in zeta diversity; (ii) distance decay; (iii) multi-site generalised dissimilarity modelling; and (iv) hierarchical scaling. Some analyses, such as the zeta decline, are specific to zeta diversity, whereas others, such as distance decay, are commonly applied to beta diversity, and have been adapted using zeta diversity to differentiate the contribution of common and rare species to compositional change.},

@article{Chao2016,
abstract = {1.There are many concepts and measures of beta diversity and related similarity/differentiation indices. The variance framework (derived from the total variance of a community species abundance matrix) and diversity decomposition (based on partitioning gamma diversity into alpha and beta components) are two major approaches. 2.There have been no bridges/links between the two approaches. Here we establish a bridge by extending and modifying each approach so that both lead to the same classes of similarity/differentiation measures, which range in the interval [0, 1] and which can be compared across multiple sets of communities. 3.Our extension/modification in each approach is based on the following major differences between the two approaches. (i) In the decomposition approach, a diversity order q that controls sensitivity to species abundances is used, whereas there is no such order involved in the variance approach. (ii) Transformations of raw abundances are typically used in the variance approach, whereas abundances are not transformed in diversity decomposition. (iii) The variance-based beta for non-transformed data is implicitly related to (and constrained by) alpha, gamma and total abundance. Namely, the attained maximum value of this beta when communities are completely distinct (no shared species) is not a fixed constant; the maximum varies with alpha, gamma and total abundance. By contrast, the beta component obtained from the multiplicative decomposition is not constrained by alpha, gamma and total abundance. 4.To construct the bridge, we extend the variance of community data to a class of divergence measures (parameterized by an order q) and use normalization to remove these measures' constraints by alpha, gamma and total abundance. The resulting normalized divergence measures are legitimate differentiation measures. In the decomposition approach, we adopt a modified multiplicative decomposition scheme; the resulting beta component can be transformed to quantify compositional similarity/differentiation among communities. Then the similarity/differentiation measures obtained from the extended variance framework turn out to be identical to those from the modified diversity decomposition, establishing the bridge. 5.Other types of similarity/differentiation measures (e.g., N-community Bray-Curtis type) and extension to phylogenetic and functional versions are discussed. A real example using corals is given for illustration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hill numbers or the effective number of species are increasingly used to quan-tify species diversity of an assemblage. Hill numbers were recently extended to phylogenetic diversity, which incorporates species evolutionary history, as well as to functional diversity, which considers the differences among species traits. We review these extensions and integrate them into a frame-work of attribute diversity (the effective number of entities or total attribute value) based on Hill numbers of taxonomic entities (species), phylogenetic entities (branches of unit-length), or functional entities (species-pairs with unit-distance between species). This framework unifies ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and distance-based functional di-versity. It also provides a unified method of decomposing these diversities and constructing normalized taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional sim-ilarity and differentiation measures, including N-assemblage phylogenetic or functional generalizations of the classic Jaccard, S{\o}rensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indexes. A real example shows how this framework extracts ecological meaning from complex data.},

These fruit were 30{\%} larger (1.9 g, 70 drupelets) than fruit from unvisited flowers. Female O. aglaia readily visited flowers of all eight diverse blackberry cultivars observed. For all of these cultivated Rubus, female O. aglaia were observed to invariably collect pollen while pivoting atop the brush of pistils, maximizing opportunities for pollen transfer. Within its native geographic range in western Oregon and California, this effective native pollinator could be a sustainably managed, economical bee for cultivated cane fruit.},

@article{Oliveira2016,
abstract = {Abstract Aim The knowledge of biodiversity facets such as species composition, distribution and ecological niche is fundamental for the construction of biogeographic hypotheses and conservation strategies. However, the knowledge on these facets is affected by major shortfalls, which are even more pronounced in the tropics. This study aims to evaluate the effect of sampling bias and variation in collection effort on Linnean, Wallacean and Hutchinsonian shortfalls and diversity measures as species richness, endemism and beta-diversity. Location Brazil. Methods We have built a database with over 1.5 million records of arthropods, vertebrates and angiosperms of Brazil, based on specimens deposited in scientific collections and on the taxonomic literature. We used null models to test the collection bias regarding the proximity to access routes. We also tested the influence of sampling effort on diversity measures by regression models. To investigate the Wallacean shortfall, we modelled the geographic distribution of over 4000 species and compared their observed distribution with models. To quantify the Hutchinsonian shortfall, we used environmental Euclidean distance of the records to identify regions with poorly sampled environmental conditions. To estimate the Linnean shortfall, we measured the similarity of species composition between regions close to and far from access routes. Results We demonstrated that despite the differences in sampling effort, the strong collection bias affects all taxonomic groups equally, generating a pattern of spatially biased sampling effort. This collection pattern contributes greatly to the biodiversity knowledge shortfalls, which directly affects the knowledge on the distribution patterns of diversity. Main conclusions The knowledge on species richness, species composition and endemism in the Brazilian biodiversity is strongly biased spatially. Despite differences in sampling effort for each taxonomic group, roadside bias affected them equally. Species composition similarity decreased with the distance from access routes, suggesting collection surveys at sites far from roads could increase the probability of sampling new geographic records or new species.},

abstract = {Land-use intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Alongside reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization at larger spatial scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic homogenization means a decrease in $\beta$-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites). Most studies have investigated losses in local ($\alpha$)-diversity and neglected biodiversity loss at larger spatial scales. Studies addressing $\beta$-diversity have focused on single or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus unknown whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different trophic levels, above- and belowground. Here we show that even moderate increases in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization across microbial, plant and animal groups, both above- and belowground, and that this is largely independent of changes in $\alpha$-diversity. We analysed a unique grassland biodiversity dataset, with abundances of more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 trophic groups. LUI, and, in particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent effects on $\beta$-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil microbial, fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These effects were nonlinear and the strongest declines in $\beta$-diversity occurred in the transition from extensively managed to intermediate intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce local $\alpha$-diversity in aboveground groups, whereas the $\alpha$-diversity increased in belowground groups. Correlations between the $\beta$-diversity of different groups, particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high LUI. This suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence for biotic homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on landscape-scale biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively managed grasslands for conserving multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, biotic homogenization rather than local diversity loss could prove to be the most substantial consequence of land-use intensification.},

abstract = {Aim To provide a global assessment of turnover in vascular plants across geographical settings and taxonomic and functional groups. We tested whether turnover and its spatial and environmental drivers are affected by the geographical setting and whether taxonomic and functional groups exhibit specific turnover patterns that are associated with their ecological characteristics. Location Global. Methods We collated a global dataset of vascular plant checklists comprising 258 island and 346 mainland units. We created subsets based on the geographical setting of study units (mainland, islands, different island types) as well as taxonomic and functional properties of species (angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophytes, trees, shrubs, herbs). For the entire dataset, and each subset, the distance decay of similarity was assessed using generalized linear models. To disentangle the relative importance of spatial and environmental drivers of turnover, we employed generalized dissimilarity models. Finally, the model results were used to predict compositional similarity of vascular plants across a global grid. Results The distance decay of similarity was stronger for mainland units than for islands. Among taxonomic and functional groups, the rate of decay was lowest for pteridophytes and highest for shrubs. Partitioning of turnover into distance- and environment-related effects revealed fundamental differences between mainland and island systems, with geographical distance being more important on the mainland than on islands. This trend was consistent across taxonomic and functional groups. Main conclusions Our results reveal an important role of geographical context in shaping beta-diversity patterns. We argue that geographical settings are characterized by specific configurations of ecological filters that have a strong impact on the magnitude and structure of turnover. Moreover, taxonomic and functional groups are differentially successful in passing these filters, resulting in group- and setting-specific turnover patterns. Exploring these interdependences for different taxa and geographical settings at different scales will help to improve our understanding of beta diversity.},

The approach is an extension of matrix regression, designed specifically to accommodate two types of nonlinearity commonly encountered in large-scaled ecological data sets: (1) the curvilinear relationship between increasing ecological distance, and observed compositional dissimilarity, between sites; and (2) the variation in the rate of compositional turnover at different positions along environmental gradients. GDM can be further adapted to accommodate special types of biological and environmental data including, for example, information on phylogenetic relationships between species and information on barriers to dispersal between geographical locations. The approach can be applied to a wide range of assessment activities including visualization of spatial patterns in community composition, constrained environmental classification, distributional modelling of species or community types, survey gap analysis, conservation assessment, and climate-change impact assessment.},

abstract = {Conservation strategies to tackle habitat loss and fragmentation require actions at the local (e.g., improving/expanding existing habitat patches) and landscape level (e.g., creating new habitat in the matrix). However, the relative importance of these actions for biodiversity is still poorly understood, leading to debate on how to prioritize conservation activities. Here, we assess the relative importance of local vs. landscape-level attributes in determining the use of woodlands by bats in fragmented landscapes; we also compare the role of habitat amount in the surrounding landscape per se vs. a combination of both habitat amount and configuration and explore whether the relative importance of these attributes varies with species mobility and landscape context. We conducted acoustic surveys in 102 woodland patches in the UK that form part of the WrEN project (www.wren-project.com), a large-scale natural experiment designed to study the effects of 160 yr of woodland creation on biodiversity and inform landscape-scale conservation. We used multivariate analysis and a model-selection approach to assess the relative importance of local (e.g., vegetation structure) and landscape-level (e.g., amount/configuration of surrounding land types) attributes on bat occurrence and activity levels. Species mobility was an important trait determining the relative importance of local vs. landscape-level attributes for different bat species. Lower mobility species were most strongly influenced by local habitat quality; the landscape became increasingly important for higher mobility species. At the landscape-scale, a combination of habitat amount and configuration appeared more important than habitat amount alone for lower mobility species, while the opposite was observed for higher mobility species. Regardless of species mobility, landscape-level attributes appeared more important for bats in a more homogeneous and intensively farmed landscape. Conservation strategies involving habitat creation and restoration should take into account the mobility of target species and prioritize landscape-level actions in more homogeneous and intensively farmed landscapes where habitat loss and fragmentation have been more severe.},

We find widespread biodiversity-profit trade-offs resulting from land-use transitions from forest and agroforestry systems to rubber and oil palm monocultures, for 26,894 aboveground and belowground species and whole-ecosystem multidiversity. Despite variation between ecosystem functions, profit gains come at the expense of ecosystem multifunctionality, indicating far-reaching ecosystem deterioration. We identify landscape compositions that can mitigate trade-offs under optimal land-use allocation but also show that intensive monocultures always lead to higher profits. These findings suggest that, to reduce losses in biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, changes in economic incentive structures through well-designed policies are urgently needed.},

We highlight here the crucial role of $\beta$-diversity – a hitherto underexplored facet of biodiversity – for a better process-level understanding of biodiversity change and its consequences for ecosystems. A focus on $\beta$-diversity has the potential to improve predictions of natural and anthropogenic influences on diversity and ecosystem functioning. However, linking the causes and consequences of biodiversity change is complex because species assemblages in nature are shaped by many factors simultaneously, including disturbance, environmental heterogeneity, deterministic niche factors, and stochasticity. Because variability and change are ubiquitous in ecosystems, acknowledging these inherent properties of nature is an essential step for further advancing scientific knowledge of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning in theory and practice.},

Unlike other measures of species compositional turnover, zeta diversity partitioning quantifies the complete set of diversity components for multiple assemblages, comprehensively representing the spatial structure of multispecies distributions. To illustrate the application and ecological value of zeta diversity, we show how it scales with sample number, grain, and distance. Zeta diversity reconciles several different biodiversity patterns, including the species accumulation curve, the species-area relationship, multispecies occupancy patterns, and scaling of species endemism. Exponential and power-law forms of zeta diversity are associated with stochastic versus niche assembly processes. Zeta diversity may provide new insights on biodiversity patterns, the processes driving them, and their response to environmental change.},

abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number qD, where q 1⁄4 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number qD, q . 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and sample- based (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q 1⁄4 0 (species richness), q 1⁄4 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q 1⁄4 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.},

abstract = {Tropical lowland rainforests are increasingly threatened by the expansion of agriculture and the extraction of natural resources. In Jambi Province, Indonesia, the interdisciplinary EFForTS project focuses on the ecological and socio-economic dimensions of rainforest conversion to jungle rubber agroforests and monoculture plantations of rubber and oil palm. Our data confirm that rainforest transformation and land use intensification lead to substantial losses in biodiversity and related ecosystem functions, such as decreased above- and below-ground carbon stocks. Owing to rapid step-wise transformation from forests to agroforests to monoculture plantations and renewal of each plantation type every few decades, the converted land use systems are continuously dynamic, thus hampering the adaptation of animal and plant communities. On the other hand, agricultural rainforest transformation systems provide increased income and access to education, especially for migrant smallholders. Jungle rubber and rubber monocultures are associated with higher financial land productivity but lower financial labour productivity compared to oil palm, which influences crop choice: smallholders that are labour-scarce would prefer oil palm while land-scarce smallholders would prefer rubber. Collecting long-term data in an interdisciplinary context enables us to provide decision-makers and stakeholders with scientific insights to facilitate the reconciliation between economic interests and ecological sustainability in tropical agricultural landscapes.},

abstract = {Land-use intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Alongside reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization at larger spatial scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic homogenization means a decrease in $\beta$-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites). Most studies have investigated losses in local ($\alpha$)-diversity and neglected biodiversity loss at larger spatial scales. Studies addressing $\beta$-diversity have focused on single or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus unknown whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different trophic levels, above- and belowground. Here we show that even moderate increases in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization across microbial, plant and animal groups, both above- and belowground, and that this is largely independent of changes in $\alpha$-diversity. We analysed a unique grassland biodiversity dataset, with abundances of more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 trophic groups. LUI, and, in particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent effects on $\beta$-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil microbial, fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These effects were nonlinear and the strongest declines in $\beta$-diversity occurred in the transition from extensively managed to intermediate intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce local $\alpha$-diversity in aboveground groups, whereas the $\alpha$-diversity increased in belowground groups. Correlations between the $\beta$-diversity of different groups, particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high LUI. This suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence for biotic homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on landscape-scale biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively managed grasslands for conserving multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, biotic homogenization rather than local diversity loss could prove to be the most substantial consequence of land-use intensification.},

abstract = {Abandoning hybrid poplar plantationsmay be an alternative strategy for enlarging natural riparian corridors along regulated rivers where forest regeneration no longer takes place. Despite the generally high local diversity of plants in poplar plantations, their capacity to converge towards riparian forests following abandonment remains largely untested and uncertain, because maintenance-related disturbance of plantations favors ruderal, not strictly riparian specialists.We assessed the spontaneous recolonization of vegetation in abandoned hybrid poplar plantations following two management strategies: harvesting or simple abandonment of standing trees.The floristic composition in four chronosequences of 10 active (1–15 years), 17 harvested (1–15 years), and 10 abandoned (8–20 years) hybrid poplar plantations, as well as 10 riparian sites established at gravel bars that appeared following the cessation of in-channel gravel mining (8–25 years) along the highly regulated Garonne River (SW France) was assessed in the framework of ecological disturbance theory. Both harvested and abandoned sites still resembled active plantations more than riparian forests. When poplar resprouting was low after harvesting, sites were dominated by light-demanding, nitrophilous herbs, sub-shrubs, and vines showing both competitive and ruderal traits, and vegetation composition remained stable over time. Abandoned and harvested sites with high poplar resprouting developed forest communities in which competitive species that tolerate and generate shade dominated, and tree species recruitment was higher. Riparian sites hosted the highest number of indicator species, mainly wetland and exotic. Simple passive restoration strategies like abandonment of plantations can help create valuable ecosystems, although ones that diverge from riparian forests colonizing new fluvial landforms. Key},

The design includes interactions between multiple buyers and sellers (household agents, developers, and rural land owners) and two local feedbacks to land value-price expectation formation based on local neighborhoods and spatial externalities. To address the methodological challenges inherent in the transition from equilibrium-based analytical models to agent-based simulation, we combine traditional deductive optimization models of behavior at the agent level with inductive models of price expectation formation. Relative to previous models, our proposed model is more closely linked to urban economics; contains a wider range of drivers of land use (LU); and addresses alternative models of division of gains from trade and determination of transaction prices, including models of bid and ask price formation. Our proposed approach is also closely linked to geographic cellular LU models, potentially uniting the strengths of these two disciplinary perspectives. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigate land-use dynamics in Jambi, Sumatra, one of the hotspots of Indonesia's recent oil palm boom. Data from a structured village survey are used to analyze the role of socioeconomic and policy factors. Oil palm is partly grown on large plantations, but smallholders are also involved to a significant extent. We find that, in spite of considerable oil palm expansion, rubber remains the dominant crop. Most of the oil palm growth takes place on previous fallow and rubber land. Oil palm has not been a major driver of deforestation. Much of the forest in Jambi was cleared more than 20 years ago, and rubber was an established cash crop long before the oil palm boom started. However, oil palm growth occurs in locations with ongoing logging activities, so indirect effects on deforestation are possible. The Indonesian government's transmigration program of the 1980s and 1990s was instrumental for the start and spread of oil palm in Jambi. Some autochthonous villages have adopted oil palm. But oil palm adoption in autochthonous villages started later and happens at a slower pace than in the villages of the transmigrants from Java.},

Ecology and Society 11(1): 49. [online] ABSTRACT. This paper combines agent-based modeling of structural change with agricultural policy analysis. Using the agent-based model AgriPoliS, we investigate the impact of a regime switch in agricultural policy on structural change under various framework conditions. Instead of first doing a sensitivity analysis to analyze the properties of our model and then examining the introduced policy in an isolated manner, we use a meta-modeling approach in combination with the statistical technique of Design of Experiments to systematically analyze the relationship between policy change and model assumptions regarding key determinants of structural change such as interest rates, managerial abilities, and technical change. As a result, we observe that the effects of policies are quite sensitive to the mentioned properties. We conclude that an isolated analysis of a policy regime switch would be of only minor value for policy advice given the ability of simulation models to examine various potential futures.},

abstract = {Landscape simulators are widely applied in landscape ecology for generating landscape patterns. These models can be divided into two categories: pattern-based models that generate spatial patterns irrespective of the processes that shape them, and process-based models that attempt to generate patterns based on the processes that shape them. The latter often tend toward complexity in an attempt to obtain high predictive precision, but are rarely used for generic or theoretical purposes. Here we show that a simple process-based simulator can generate a variety of spatial patterns including realistic ones, typifying landscapes fragmented by anthropogenic activities. The model “G-RaFFe” generates roads and fields to reproduce the processes in which forests are converted into arable lands. For a selected level of habitat cover, three factors dominate its outcomes: the number of roads (accessibility), maximum field size (accounting for land ownership patterns), and maximum field disconnection (which enables field to be detached from roads). We compared the performance of G-RaFFe to three other models: Simmap (neutral model), Qrule (fractal-based) and Dinamica EGO (with 4 model versions differing in complexity). A PCA-based analysis indicated G-RaFFe and Dinamica version 4 (most complex) to perform best in matching realistic spatial patterns, but an alternative analysis which considers model variability identified G-RaFFe and Qrule as performing best. We also found model performance to be affected by habitat cover and the actual land-uses, the latter reflecting on land ownership patterns. We suggest that simple process-based generators such as G-RaFFe can be used to generate spatial patterns as templates for theoretical analyses, as well as for gaining better understanding of the relation between spatial processes and patterns. We suggest caution in applying neutral or fractal-based approaches, since spatial patterns that typify anthropogenic landscapes are often non-fractal in nature.},

abstract = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified.},

Results derived via computational experiments show that land-market modelling decisions do affect outcomes, improving to an extent the relative success of innovators.

abstract = {Specialization in agricultural systems can lead to trade-offs between economic gains and ecosystem functions. We suggest and explore a conceptual framework in which economic gains can be maximized when production activities are specialized at increasingly broader scales (from the household to the village, region or above), particularly when markets for outputs and inputs function well. Conversely, more specialization likely reduces biodiversity and significantly limits ecosystem functions. When agricultural specialization increases and moves to broader scales as a result of improved infrastructure and markets or other drivers, ecosystem functions can also be endangered at broader spatial scales. Policies to improve agricultural incomes may influence the level of specialization at different scales and thus affect the severity of the trade-offs. This paper takes Jambi province in Indonesia, a current hotspot of rubber and oil palm monoculture, as a case study to illustrate these issues. We empirically show that the level of specialization differs across scales with higher specialization at household and village levels and higher diversification towards the province level. We discuss ways to resolve trade-offs between economic gains and ecological costs, including landscape design, targeted policies, and adoption of long-term perspectives.},

abstract = {There is an increasing need for an assessment of the impacts of land use and land use change (LUCC). In this context, simulation models are valuable tools for investigating the impacts of stakeholder actions or policy decisions. Agricultural landscape generators (ALGs), which systematically and automatically generate realistic but simplified representations of land cover in agricultural landscapes, can provide the input for LUCC models. We reviewed existing ALGs in terms of their objectives, design and scope. We found eight ALGs that met our definition. They were based either on generic mathematical algorithms (pattern-based) or on representations of ecological or land use processes (process-based). Most ALGs integrate only a few landscape metrics, which limits the design of the landscape pattern and thus the range of applications. For example, only a few specific farming systems have been implemented. We conclude that existing ALGs contain useful approaches that can be used for specific purposes, but ideally generic modular ALGs are developed that can be used for a wide range of scenarios, regions and model types. We have compiled features of such generic ALGs and propose a possible software architecture. Considerable joint efforts are required to develop such generic ALGs, but the benefits in terms of a better understanding and development of more efficient agricultural policies would be high.},

abstract = {Tropical regions, such as Sumatra, experiencing extensive transformation of natural ecosystems, are close to complete exhaustion of available land. Agroecosystems strongly modify water and nutrient cycles, leading to losses of soil fertility, C sequestration and biodiversity. Although large companies are the main drivers of deforestation and plantation establishment, smallholders account for 40{\%} of the oil palm and the majority of the rubber production in Indonesia. Here, we assess the extent and mechanisms of soil degradation under smallholder oil palm and rubber plantations in a context of land scarcity. The topsoil properties (C and N contents, C stocks, C/N ratio, bulk density) in 207 oil palm and rubber plantations in the Jambi province of Sumatra were determined beside trees, inside rows and interrows. Soils under oil palms were on average more degraded than under rubber, showing lower C content and stocks, lower N and higher bulk density. While soil properties were homogenous under rubber, two opposite trends were observed under oil palm plantations: the majority of soils had C content {\textless}2.2{\%}, but about one fifth of the plantations had {\textgreater}9{\%} C. This resulted from the establishment of oil palms under conditions of land scarcity. Because the oil palm boom started when rubber was already well-established, oil palms were frequently planted in marginal areas, such as peatlands or riparian areas (high C) or soils degraded by previous use (low C). The management of oil palms led to subsequent soil degradation, especially in interrows: C content decreased and bulk density increased in older oil palm plantations. This was not observed in rubber plantations because of a C input from leaf litter spread homogeneously all over the plantation, higher ground cover and a limited use of motorized vehicles. Considering that 10{\%} of soils under oil palms had very low C content ({\textless}1{\%}), we conclude that intensive cultivation can lead to intensive soil degradation and expect future degradation of soils under young oil palms. This challenges the sustainability of agricultural intensification in Sumatra. Because Sumatra is a pioneer of tropical land-use change, this should be regarded as potential threats that other tropical regions may face in future.},

abstract = {The term riparian refers to the biotic communities and the environment$\backslash$non the shores of streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and some wetlands.$\backslash$nIn this chapter, the phrase riparian forest refers to vegetation$\backslash$ndirectly adjacent to rivers and streams. The riparian forest extends$\backslash$nlaterally from the active channel to the uplands, thereby including$\backslash$nactive floodplains and the immediately adjacent terraces. l Riparian$\backslash$nforests of the Pacific coastal ecoregion are floristically and structurally$\backslash$nthe most diverse vegetation of the region. As complex ecological$\backslash$nsystems localized at the land-water ecotone, riparian forests maintain$\backslash$ngenerally high levels of beta and gamma diversity, exhibit high rates$\backslash$nof nutrient cycling and productivity, provide specialized ecological$\backslash$nfunctions (e.g., maintain water quality), and exert strong influences$\backslash$non adjacent ecological systems by modifying the flow of materials$\backslash$nand information (i.e., sound, visual communication) across the landscape.$\backslash$nAlterations to riparian forests have effects that go far beyond the$\backslash$nspecific activity, with the ecological consequences felt throughout$\backslash$nthe entire river corridor. l The spatial extent of the riparian forest$\backslash$nvaries longitudinally and laterally throughout the drainage network.$\backslash$nThe extent is a function of valley morphology, physical processes$\backslash$n(such as climate and hydrology), and vegetative legacies and life$\backslash$nhistory strategies. The basis for understanding riparian forest dynamics,$\backslash$ntherefore, is the watershed's geomorphology and the physical processes$\backslash$noccurring therein. l Plants of the riparian forest have numerous$\backslash$nmorphological, physiological and reproductive adaptations for life$\backslash$nin variable environments. Specific adaptations include those related$\backslash$nto flooding, sediment deposition, physical abrasion and stem breakage.$\backslash$nFor example, some riparian plants tree species establish and grow$\backslash$nupon large woody debris (LWD), while other species require the mineral$\backslash$nsoils of floodplains, and even others need saturated or flooded soils.$\backslash$nl Three closely related processes and interactions determine patterns$\backslash$nof riparian forest development and structure: responses to disturbances,$\backslash$nsoil dynamics, and biological characteristics related to succession.$\backslash$nSeveral case studies illustrate the variety of successional patterns$\backslash$nin natural settings. l Complex, interactive relationships between$\backslash$nriparian forest structure and ecosystem function impart vitality,$\backslash$nnot only to the forest, but also to the stream environment. In channels,$\backslash$nLWD partially controls the routing of water and sediment which creates$\backslash$nand maintains a variety of habitats. Roots improve stream bank stability$\backslash$nand sequester nutrients.Floodplain vegetation captures and holds$\backslash$nparticles while the forest canopy controls the light regime as well$\backslash$nas provides seasonal nourishment for organisms in the form of leaves,$\backslash$nneedles, and wood. Riparian influences on microclimate and plant$\backslash$ndiversity are determined by forest structure at several hierarchical$\backslash$nspatiotemporal scales. l Hydrologic alteration caused by river regulation$\backslash$nand forest management alters a variety of processes necessary for$\backslash$nthe establishment and maintenance of riparian vegetation. Riparian$\backslash$nforests are affected not only by alteration of the hydrologic regime$\backslash$nbut also by humaninduced changes in the transport of materials. The$\backslash$nsite-specific ecological consequences of these two changes remain$\backslash$ndifficult to predict but include alterations in species composition$\backslash$nand distribution and changes in sediment moisture retention and soil$\backslash$nbiogeochemical cycles.},

abstract = {Indonesia lost more tropical forest than all of Brazil in 2012, mainly driven by the rubber, oil palm, and timber industries. Nonetheless, the effects of converting forest to oil palm and rubber plantations on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks remain unclear. We analyzed SOC losses after lowland rainforest conversion to oil palm, intensive rubber, and extensive rubber plantations in Jambi Province on Sumatra Island. The focus was on two processes: (1) erosion and (2) decomposition of soil organic matter. Carbon contents in the Ah horizon under oil palm and rubber plantations were strongly reduced up to 70{\%} and 62{\%}, respectively. The decrease was lower under extensive rubber plantations (41{\%}). On average, converting forest to plantations led to a loss of 10 Mg C ha(-1) after about 15 years of conversion. The C content in the subsoil was similar under the forest and the plantations. We therefore assumed that a shift to higher $\delta$(13) C values in plantation subsoil corresponds to the losses from the upper soil layer by erosion. Erosion was estimated by comparing the $\delta$(13) C profiles in the soils under forest and under plantations. The estimated erosion was the strongest in oil palm (35 ± 8 cm) and rubber (33 ± 10 cm) plantations. The (13) C enrichment of SOC used as a proxy of its turnover indicates a decrease of SOC decomposition rate in the Ah horizon under oil palm plantations after forest conversion. Nonetheless, based on the lack of C input from litter, we expect further losses of SOC in oil palm plantations, which are a less sustainable land use compared to rubber plantations. We conclude that $\delta$(13) C depth profiles may be a powerful tool to disentangle soil erosion and SOC mineralization after the conversion of natural ecosystems conversion to intensive plantations when soils show gradual increase of $\delta$(13) C values with depth.},

abstract = {Restoring the flooding-related disturbance regime by removing and setting back flood defenses (channel widening) is themost efficient strategy for recovering riparian plant communities in floodplains formerly impacted by human activities such as agriculture,mining, and forestry.Removing flood defenses is generally not socially accepted, and alternative recovery strategies must be explored.We assessed vegetation establishment on 33 sites in the floodplains of the Middle Ebro River and three of its tributaries (NE Spain) where restoration approaches applied in the last 20 years include channel widening, floodplain excavation, and abandonment of agriculture, gravel extraction, and hybrid poplar plantations, with and without plantation of native species. Using analysis of similarity and ordinations, we found that channel widening led to plant communities closely resembling those found on natural gravel bars, including new recruits of keystone tree species. Excavation of the floodplain as the restoration approach resulted in pioneer, non-strictly riparian communities.Abandonment of agricultural land or clearing of poplar plantations resulted in alternative stable states predominating, regardless of time elapsed since restoration and whether poles of native species were planted. However, forest-like communities relatively similar to mature, natural riparian references were attainable when hybrid poplars were allowed to resprout after clear-cutting, or after the human activities were abandoned and trees were not cut. Combining channel widening and assisted revegetation where flood defenses cannot be alteredmay partially reproduce a mosaic of habitats typical of natural floodplains},

abstract = {The demand for energy and forestry products is globally increasing, raising the question if traditional breeding programs are efficient and fast enough to keep up with these demands. A possible solution seems to be the use of genetic engineering techniques, since classical breeding strategies are time-consuming and limited by species barriers. Besides the advantages of genetic engineering technologies, concerns are also raised by scientists regarding these methods. Consequently, risk analysis of genetic modified trees in plantation forestry is a fundamental research topic. This paper presents a sequence of steps in risk analysis dealing with genetic modified poplar clones in the natural environment, ranging from investigations of flowering phenology, to molecular identification of gene flow patterns and their statistical interpretation, to modeling approaches to simulate different scenarios of plantations using genetic modified poplars in realistic European landscapes. All steps are evaluated for their potential to forecast the risk of outcrossing of gene constructs into native populations. The application of the results achieved to short rotation plantations are discussed.},

Global protection of ecologically valuable roadless areas is inadequate. International recognition and protection of roadless areas is urgently needed to halt their continued loss.},

abstract = {Dynamic crop models are frequently used in ecology, agronomy and environmental sciences for simulating crop and environmental variables at a discrete time step. They often include a large number of parameters whose values are uncertain, and it is often impossible to estimate all these parameters accurately. A common practice consists in selecting a subset of parameters by global sensitivity analysis, estimating the selected parameters from data, and setting the others to some nominal values. For a discrete-time model, global sensitivity analyses can be applied sequentially at each simulation date. In the case of dynamic crop models, simulations are usually computed at a daily time step and the sequential implementation of global sensitivity analysis at each simulation date can result in several hundreds of sensitivity indices, with one index per parameter per simulation date. It is not easy to identify the most important parameters based on such a large number of values. In this paper, an alternative method called multivariate global sensitivity analysis was investigated. More precisely, the purposes of this paper are (i) to compare the sensitivity indices and associated parameter rankings computed by the sequential and the multivariate global sensitivity analyses, (ii) to assess the value of multivariate sensitivity analysis for selecting the model parameters to estimate from data. Sequential and multivariate sensitivity analyses were compared by using two dynamic models: a model simulating wheat biomass named WWDM and a model simulating N2O gaseous emission in crop fields named CERES-EGC. N2O measurements collected in several experimental plots were used to evaluate how parameter selection based on multivariate sensitivity analysis can improve the CERES-EGC predictions. The results showed that sequential and multivariate sensitivity analyses provide modellers with different types of information for models which exhibit a high variability of sensitivity index values over time. Conversely, when the parameter influence is quite constant over time, the two methods give more similar results. The results also showed that the estimation of the parameters with the highest sensitivity indices led to a strong reduction of the prediction errors of the model CERES-EGC. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Pattern–process analysis is one of the main threads in landscape ecological research. It aims at understanding the complex relationships between ecological processes and landscape patterns, identifying the underlying mechanisms and deriving valid predictions for scenarios of landscape change and its consequences. Today, various studies cope with these tasks through so called “landscape modelling” approaches. They integrate different aspects of heterogeneous and dynamic landscapes and model different driving forces, often using both statistical and process-oriented techniques. We identify two main approaches to deal with the analysis of pattern–process interactions: the first starts with pattern detection, pattern description and pattern analysis, the second with process description, simulation and pattern generation. Focussing on the interplay between these two approaches, landscape analysis and landscape modelling will improve our understanding of pattern–process interactions. The comparison of simulated and observed pattern is a prerequisite for both approaches. Therefore, we identify a set of quantitative, robust, and reproducible methods for the analysis of spatiotemporal patterns that is a starting point for a standard toolbox for ecologists as major future challenge and suggest necessary further methodological developments.},

The species of this genus are self-incompatible and have very long life spans. The focus of our review is on the effects of gene flow on the structuration of genetic variation in these species. We have examined the influence of gene flow in 2 ways: 1) by measuring the physical dispersal of pollen, seed and vegetative organs; and 2) by using nuclear and cytoplasmic markers to estimate genetic parameters (Fis, Nm). These approaches have shown that nuclear (isozyme markers) as well as cytoplasmic (chloroplastic DNA) gene flow is usually high, so that very low interspecific differentiation occurs. However, intraspecific differentiation is higher for the cytoplasmic DNA than for the nuclear isozyme markers},

abstract = {Current rates of environmental change are exceeding the capacity of many populations to adapt to new conditions and thus avoid demographic collapse and ultimate extinction. In particular, cold-water freshwater fish species are predicted to experience strong selective pressure from climate change and a wide range of interacting anthropogenic stressors in the near future. To implement effective management and conservation measures, it is crucial to quantify the maximum rate of change that cold-water freshwater fish populations can withstand. Here, we present a spatially explicit eco-genetic individual-based model, inSTREAM-Gen, to predict the eco-evolutionary dynamics of stream-dwelling trout under anthropogenic environmental change. The model builds on a well-tested demographic model, which includes submodels of river dynamics, bioenergetics, and adaptive habitat selection, with a new genetic module that allows exploration of genetic and life-history adaptations to new environments. The genetic module models the transmission of two key traits, size at emergence and maturity size threshold. We parameterized the model for a brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) population at the warmest edge of its range to validate it and analyze its sensitivity to parameters under contrasting thermal profiles. To illustrate potential applications of the model, we analyzed the population's demographic and evolutionary dynamics under scenarios of (1) climate change-induced warming, and (2) warming plus flow reduction resulting from climate and land use change, compared to (3) a baseline of no environmental change. The model predicted severe declines in density and biomass under climate warming. These declines were lower than expected at range margins because of evolution towards smaller size at both emergence and maturation compared to the natural evolution under the baseline conditions. Despite stronger evolutionary responses, declining rates were substantially larger under the combined warming and flow reduction scenario, leading to a high probability of population extinction over contemporary time frames. Therefore, adaptive responses could not prevent extinction under high rates of environmental change. Our model demonstrates critical elements of next generation ecological modelling aiming at predictions in a changing world as it accounts for spatial and temporal resource heterogeneity, while merging individual behaviour and bioenergetics with microevolutionary adaptations.},

abstract = {Rapid deforestation in Sumatra, Indonesia is presently occurring due to the expansion of palm oil and rubber production, fueled by an increasing global demand. Our study aimed to assess changes in soil-N cycling rates with conversion of forest to oil palm (Elaeis guineen- sis) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations. In Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia, we selected two soil landscapes – loamand clay Acrisol soils – each with four land-use types: lowland forest and forest with regenerating rubber (hereafter, “jungle rubber”) as reference land uses, and rubber and oil palm as converted land uses. Gross soil-N cycling rates were measured using the 15N pool dilution technique with in-situ incubation of soil cores. In the loam Acrisol soil, where fertility was low, microbial biomass, gross N mineralization and NH4 + immobilization were also low and no significant changes were detected with land-use conversion. The clay Acrisol soil which had higher initial fertility based on the reference land uses (i.e. higher pH, organic C, total N, effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) and base saturation) (P 0.05–0.09) had larger microbial biomass and NH4 + transformation rates (P 0.05) compared to the loam Acrisol soil. Conversion of forest and jungle rubber to rubber and oil palm in the clay Acrisol soil decreased soil fertility which, in turn, reduced microbial biomass and consequently decreased NH4 + transformation rates (P 0.05–0.09). This was further attested by the correlation of gross N mineralization andmicrobial biomass N with ECEC, organic C, total N (R=0.51–0. 76; P 0.05) and C:N ratio (R=-0.71 – -0.75, P 0.05). Our findings suggest that the larger the initial soil fertility and N availability, the larger the reductions upon land-use conversion. Because soil N availability was dependent on microbial biomass, management practices in converted oil palm and rubber plantations should focus on enriching microbial biomass.},

However, due to the inherent diversity of ecology, myriad unrelated approaches seem to exist, with different sub-disciplines developing along different pathways. This limits coherence and effectiveness in ecological modelling and theory development. We therefore organized this special issue and started by adopting the term “next-generation” from gene sequencing to make authors focus on those distinct advances in methods and strategies. We are not entirely serious about the term “next-generation”, as it seems more a marketing strategy for technologies than a reference to scientific revolutions in the sense of Kuhn (1962). Nevertheless, even if advances in ecological research are more gradual than abrupt, we believe that essential elements of next-generation modelling can be identified today. We identified three such elements: (1) Structural Realism, (2) Emergence and (3) Predictions, and invited contributions addressing concepts, modelling approaches, or theories related to these elements ( Grimm and Berger, 2016a).},

We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible.

This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels.We explain which aspects of amodel should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix.We consider ODD as a first step for establishing amore detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

abstract = {This paper presents a spatial multi-agent programming model, which has been developed for assessing policy options in the diffusion of innovations and resource use changes. Unlike conventional simulation tools used in agricultural economics, the model class described here applies a multi-agent/cellular automata (CA) approach by using heterogeneous farm-household models and capturing their social and spatial interactions explicitly. The individual choice of the farm-household among available production, consumption, investment and marketing alternatives is represented in recursive linear programming models. Adoption constraints are introduced in form of network-threshold values that reflect the cumulative effects of experience and observation of peers' experiences. The model's economic and hydrologic components are tightly connected into a spatial framework. The integration of economic and hydrologic processes facilitates the consideration of feedback effects in the use of water for irrigation. The simulation runs of the model are carried out with an empirical data set, which has been derived from various data sources on an agricultural region in Chile. Simulation results show that agent-based spatial modelling constitutes a powerful approach to better understanding processes of innovation and resource use change. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The two main challenges of ecological modelling are to yield more general understanding and theory and to provide testable and robust predictions. To achieve this, emergence, structural realism, and prediction have to become key elements of designing models. In the special issue “Next-generation ecological modelling”, which is dedicated to Donald DeAngelis on the occasion of his 70th birthday, 16 contributions present and discuss main features of next-generation ecological modelling. One key feature is to base the description of individuals' behaviour and interactions on first principles rooted in energetic or evolutionary theory. To cope with increasing model complexity, standardization, separate testing of alternative submodels against multiple output patterns, and documenting these tests will be required. Including micro-evolution is essential to capture organisms' response to changing conditions. Functional types may be used instead of species for representing communities. Model analysis will be challenging, but robustness analysis, which tries to break models' explanations, can help to tell signals from noise and identify general mechanisms underlying the internal organization of ecological systems. Ultimately, next-generation modelling should aim at developing general theory to better understand stability properties and mechanisms. This understanding then can provide the basis for restoring, maintaining, or strengthening the resilience of ecosystems and supporting sustainable management of natural resources.},

abstract = {Trajectories of plant communities can be described by different models of plant succession. While a Clementsian (gradual continuum model) or Gleasonian approach (relay floristics model) has traditionally been used to inform restoration outcomes, alternative succession models developed recently may better represent restoration trajectories. The threshold dynamics succession model, which predicts an abrupt species turnover after an environmental threshold is crossed, has never been used in a restoration context. This model might, however, better describe shifts in plant competitive ranking and facilitation interactions during species turnover. Fifty-three riparian zones, planted with trees 3-17 years prior to sampling, and 14 natural riparian forests were studied in two agricultural watersheds of south-eastern Qu{\'{e}}bec (Canada). The cover of vegetation strata was assessed at the site scale, and the cover of plant species was estimated in a total of 784 1-m2 plots. Canopy cover was measured stereoscopically for each plot. As revealed by Principal Response Curves and broken stick models, herbaceous species composition was stable during the first 12-13 years after tree planting, but then abruptly shifted. This two-step pattern in species turnover followed the increase in canopy cover after tree planting. Once canopy cover passed a threshold of ca 40{\%}, plant succession started and led to the re-establishment of forest communities 17 years after planting. Following herbaceous species turnover, the cover of ecological groups changed significantly towards covers of natural riparian forests: shade-tolerant species generally increased, while light-demanding and non-native species decreased. Vegetation structure was also significantly affected by tree planting: tree and shrub cover increased, while monocot cover decreased. Synthesis and applications. Tree planting efficiently restored herbaceous forest communities in riparian zones by inducing a species turnover mediated by light availability corresponding to the threshold dynamics model in plant succession. Fostering and monitoring canopy closure in tree-planted riparian zones should improve restoration success and the design of alternative strategies. The innovative statistical approach of this study aiming to identify succession patterns and their associated theoretical models can guide future restoration in any type of ecosystem around the world to bridge the gap between science and management. {\textcopyright} 2016 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Representing human decisions is of fundamental importance in agent-based models. However, the rationale for choosing a particular human decision model is often not sufficiently empirically or theoretically substantiated in the model documentation. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare models because the model descriptions are often incomplete, not transparent and difficult to understand. Therefore, we expand and refine the ‘ODD' (Overview, Design Concepts and Details) protocol to establish a standard for describing ABMs that includes human decision-making (ODD + D). Because the ODD protocol originates mainly from an ecological perspective, some adaptations are necessary to better capture human decision-making. We extended and rearranged the design concepts and related guiding questions to differentiate and describe decision-making, adaptation and learning of the agents in a comprehensive and clearly structured way. The ODD + D protocol also incorporates a section on ‘Theoretical and Empirical Background' to encourage model designs and model assumptions that are more closely related to theory. The application of the ODD + D protocol is illustrated with a description of a social–ecological ABM on water use. Although the ODD + D protocol was developed on the basis of example implementations within the socio-ecological scientific community, we believe that the ODD + D protocol may prove helpful for describing ABMs in general when human decisions are included.},

abstract = {Oil palm is one of the most rapidly expanding crops throughout the humid tropics. In Indonesia, the expansion is largely driven by smallholder farmers. While recent research has studied effects for the environment and climate change, socioeconomic impacts in the small farm sector have hardly been analyzed. Here, we address this research gap by analyzing effects of oil palm adoption on farm household living standards and nutrition in Sumatra. Using survey data and econometric models, we estimate average impacts, impact pathways, and impact heterogeneity. Results show that oil palm adoption improves household living standards and nutrition. Mean impacts on food and non-food expenditures, as well as on calorie consumption and dietary quality, are all positive and significant. A sizeable part of the total effects is attributable to oil palm adopters expanding their farm size rather than realizing higher profits per hectare. Oil palm has lower labor requirements than alternative crops (especially rubber), so that adopting farmers are able to manage larger land areas. Labor saved through switching from rubber to oil palm is also used to increase off-farm incomes. Impact heterogeneity is analyzed with quantile regressions. We find positive effects of oil palm adoption across the entire expenditure distribution. However, the absolute gains in total expenditures and non-food expenditures are larger for the better-off, suggesting that oil palm may contribute to rising inequality.},

The search for general principles underlying the internal organization of such systems often uses bottom-up simulation models such as cellular automata and agent-based models. No general framework for designing, testing, and analyzing bottom-up models has yet been established, but recent advances in ecological modeling have come together in a general strategy we call pattern-oriented modeling. This strategy provides a unifying framework for decoding the internal organization of agent-based complex systems and may lead toward unifying algorithmic theories of the relation between adaptive behavior and system complexity.},

abstract = {Riverine ecosystems are recurrently rejuvenated during destructive flood events and vegetation succession starts again. Poplars (i.e. species from Populus genera) respond to hydrogeomorphological constraints, but, in turn, also influence these processes. Thus, poplar development on bare mineral substrates is not exclusively a one-way vegetative process. Reciprocal interactions and adjustments between poplar species and sediment dynamics during their life cycle lead to the emergence of biogeomorphological entities within the fluvial corridor, such as vegetated islands, benches and floodplains. Based on a review of geomorphological, biological and ecological literature, we have identified and described the co-constructing processes between riparian poplars and their fluvial environment. We have explored the possibility that the modification of the hydrogeomorphological environment exerted, in particular, by the European black poplar (Populus nigra L.), increases its fitness and thus results in positive niche construction. We focus on the fundamental phases of dispersal, recruitment and establishment until sexual maturity of P. nigra by describing the hierarchy of interactions and the pattern of feedbacks between biotic and abiotic components. We explicitly relate the biological life cycle of P. nigra to the fluvial biogeomorphic succession model by referring to the ‘biogeomorphological life cycle' of P. nigra. Finally, we propose new research perspectives based on this theoretical framework.},

Such a seamless integration of a widely used agent-based modeling platform with a well-known statistical computing and graphics environment opens up various possibilities. For example, it enables the modeler to design simulation experiments, store simulation results, and analyze simulation output in a more systematic way. It can therefore help close the gaps in agent-based modeling regarding standards of description and analysis.

abstract = {Under natural conditions the zonation of woody species in floodplains is to a large extent determined by hydrological conditions. Flood survival varies even among closely related species of the same genus. Most studies that quantify flood survival of seedlings and saplings of European floodplain species focus on species of the genera Salix and Populus, while few studies on saplings of Quercus robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Crataegus monogyna have been carried out, and even less on comparing these species groups. We performed a comparative observational study on the presence of saplings ({\textless} 150 cm) of Quercus robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Crataegus monogyna (hardwood species), Salix alba, Salix viminalis and Populus nigra (softwood species) in nature reserves along the Lower Rhine in the Netherlands. For each plot (n = 1178) the duration, frequency and depth of inundation was determined. This was done for both the entire year (January-December) and the growing season (March-October). We found that the presence of the hardwoods decreased with increasing inundation duration and even more so if the inundation occurred during the growing season. Contrary to what is generally assumed, the negative effects of flooding were stronger for E excelsior than for Q. robur. For the hardwood group the total annual inundation duration was the best explanatory variable. The presence of the softwood species increased with increasing inundation duration and more so if the inundation occurred during the growing season. The average duration per inundation event was the best explanatory variable for this group, especially for both Salix species. The presence of R nigra was best explained by the average inundation depth. A canonical correspondence analysis on species composition was consistent with these findings. Overall, our results agree with the general perspective of tree zonation along rivers. This is the first study that shows the singular and combined effects of several flooding characteristics on both presence, and species composition, of softwood and hardwood species from riparian woodlands. We outline an approach indicating how the results can be used for the selection of sections in retention areas suitable for the recruitment of the studied tree species. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {European black poplar (Populus nigra L.) has become threatened by the widespread disappearance of riparian forests in Europe. Gene introgression through hybridization with related, non-indigenous poplar taxa may additionally reduce the population size and genetic diversity of native black poplar. We assessed the exposure of native black poplar in Slovenia to genetic introgression using a combination of habitat and gene flow models. The habitat model was built with data mining on forest inventory data employing classification decision trees. Dispersion distances for pollen, seeds and vegetative parts at 0.9{\%} and 0.001{\%} of adventitious presence threshold were assessed using modified gene flow models. To protect native black poplar, protection zones around native black poplar stands were proposed. Since the population of native black poplar may be exposed to various introgression pressures (e.g., the vicinity of exotic, genetically compatible poplar plantations, or feral populations potentially initiated along transport corridors or rivers), we assessed the intensity of introgression pressure by intersecting the occupied and potential habitat with the introgression pressure areas. In 2010, native black poplar occurred on 43,756ha (2.2{\%} of the total Slovenian territory), while the suitable habitat extended up to 108,724ha (5.4{\%}). The protection zones were 0.5–4.6 times larger than the occupied and potential habitat depending on the selected threshold and the type of dispersion vector. In the worst case scenario, 45.1{\%} of protection zones would be exposed to high hybridization pressure. We recommend extending the proposed methodological approach to other regions with endangered black poplar.},

abstract = {Land-use changes have dramatically transformed tropical landscapes. We describe an ecological-economic land-use change model as an integrated, exploratory tool used to analyze how tropical land-use change affects ecological and socio-economic functions. The model analysis seeks to determine what kind of landscape mosaic can improve the ensemble of ecosystem functioning, biodiversity, and economic benefit based on the synergies and trade-offs that we have to account for. More specifically, (1) how do specific ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage, and economic functions, such as household consumption, relate to each other? (2) How do external factors, such as the output prices of crops, affect these relationships? (3) How do these relationships change when production inefficiency differs between smallholder farmers and learning is incorporated? We initialize the ecological-economic model with artificially generated land-use maps parameterized to our study region. The economic sub-model simulates smallholder land-use management decisions based on a profit maximization assumption. Each household determines factor inputs for all household fields and decides on land-use change based on available wealth. The ecological sub-model includes a simple account of carbon sequestration in above-ground and below-ground vegetation. We demonstrate model capabilities with results on household consumption and carbon sequestration from different output price and farming efficiency scenarios. The overall results reveal complex interactions between the economic and ecological spheres. For instance, model scenarios with heterogeneous crop-specific household productivity reveal a comparatively high inertia of land-use change. Our model analysis even shows such an increased temporal stability in landscape composition and carbon stocks of the agricultural area under dynamic price trends. These findings underline the utility of ecological-economic models, such as ours, to act as exploratory tools which can advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the trade-offs and synergies of ecological and economic functions in tropical landscapes.},

abstract = {Variance based methods have assessed themselves as versatile and effective among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y=f(X1,X2,{\ldots},Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of evaluations of f(X1,X2,{\ldots},Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f(X1,X2,{\ldots},Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to use.},

We combine spatial information on various biophysical, demographic and infrastructural factors in the Brazilian Amazon with satellite data on deforestation to evaluate the relative importance of each factor to deforestation in the region. We assess the sensitivity of results to alternative sampling methodologies, and compare our results to those of previous empirical studies of Amazonian deforestation. Our findings, in concert with those of previous studies, send a clear message to planners: both paved and unpaved roads are key drivers of the deforestation process. Proximity to previous clearings, high population densities, low annual rainfall, and long dry seasons also increase the likelihood that a site will be deforested; however, roads are consistently important and are the factors most amenable to policymaking. We argue that there is ample evidence to justify a fundamental change in current Amazonian development priorities if additional large-scale losses of forests and environmental services are to be avoided.},

abstract = {Many riparian ecosystems in European temperate regions have lost their inherent, highly dynamic character due to human-induced impacts such as river channelization and flow regulation. The lower course of the Allier River (France) is one of the last remaining free meandering river segments, and thus, constitutes an opportunity to investigate riparian succession processes of a dynamic, temperate river system. We analyzed (i) the dynamics of the succession phases based on eight sets of aerial images of the riparian corridor over the last five decades (1967-2014), (ii) the dominant succession trajectories and (iii) their relation with the Allier River flow regime. Results revealed that the study site was characterized by a shifting habitat mosaic between 1967 and 2005, whilst floods did not change the overall habitat composition of the riparian corridor but their distribution in space. After the year 2005, progression and retrogression processes have been drastically reduced, with an increase of stability (i.e. no more channel migration and neither progression nor retrogression of patches), and a concomitant reduction of high and moderate magnitude floods. This study depicts a clear threshold of trajectory change in succession processes since the beginning of the 21st century and facilitates a better understanding of future trajectories under current global climate change.},

abstract = {Recent developments in landscape ecology have emphasised the functional role of heterogeneity of mosaics such as a “patchworks” of agricultural fields. Explicit (process) landscape models are important tools to study this functional role, although very few model are dedicated to patchy landscape dynamics. We construct such a model (L1) manipulating patches (polygons) instead of pixels by a combination of pure attributive or geometrical modifications. In addition, our aim was to build a perennial and dynamic software platform. Hence, the L1 platform contributes to the design of distinct scenarios, as well as distinct models of (forested, agricultural, suburban{\ldots}) landscapes. It is designed around a kernel modelling, a generic patchy landscape that could be progressively driven to follow natural (climatic, ecological{\ldots}) forces and human (sociological, economical{\ldots}) decisions. We present, here, the first model of the L1 platform with an application on a Brittany agricultural landscape and four simplified scenarios. We focused on human decisions driving the patchy mosaic and demonstrated the importance of taking into account the different decision levels, from the main characteristics of the European Common Agricultural Policies (CAP) to the farmer individual land use allocation. Results are a set of rules that reproduces Brittany landscape evolutions with increasing complexity driving-decisions, and therefore, with increasing realism degree. They illustrate part of the L1 platform flexibility.},

abstract = {NetLogo has become a standard platform for agent-based simulation, yet there appears to be widespread belief that it is not suitable for large and complex models due to slow execution. Our experience does not support that belief. NetLogo programs often do run very slowly when written to minimize code length and maximize clarity, but relatively simple and easily tested changes can almost always produce major increases in execution speed. We recommend a five-step process for quantifying execution speed, identifying slow parts of code, and writing faster code. Avoiding or improving agent filtering statements can often produce dramatic speed improvements. For models with extensive initialization methods, reorganizing the setup procedure can reduce the initialization effort in simulation experiments. Programming the same behavior in a different way can sometimes provide order-of-magnitude speed increases. For models in which most agents do nothing on most time steps, discrete event simulation—facilitated by the time extension to NetLogo—can dramatically increase speed. NetLogo's BehaviorSpace tool makes it very easy to conduct multiple-model-run experiments in parallel on either desktop or high performance cluster computers, so even quite slow models can be executed thousands of times. NetLogo also is supported by efficient analysis tools, such as BehaviorSearch and RNetLogo, that can reduce the number of model runs and the effort to set them up for (e.g.) parameterization and sensitivity analysis.},

abstract = {The Salicaceae and Betulaceae are important plant families within riparian ecosystems throughout the Northern hemisphere, and cuttings of species within these families are often used in riparian restoration projects due to their capacity for vegetative (asexual) propagation and rapid growth. Riparian zones can experience a wide range of hydrological conditions and establishing cuttings may be subjected to substantially varying levels of hydric stress from inundation and drought. Tolerance to such stress can vary notably between species, and the absence of knowledge of species-specific responses to inundation and drought has resulted in high mortality in many riparian restoration projects. In this paper, the survival and growth responses of Salix elaeagnos (Salicaceae), Populus nigra (Salicaceae) and Alnus incana (Betulaceae) cuttings in relation to varying rates of water table decline and periods of inundation were investigated using rhizopods during a 69-day greenhouse experiment, in substrates of contrasting sediments (sand versus gravel). Each species responded differently to the experimental treatments. S. elaeagnos demonstrated an ability to establish in stable, declining and inundated conditions by the production of relatively substantial root and shoot biomass in all treatments, along with elongated roots when experiencing water table decline. P. nigra showed high mortality and poor root and shoot production in inundation treatments, suggesting that this species is intolerant to reduced oxygen conditions. A. incana displayed complete mortality in all gravel-based treatments and high mortality or poor growth in the sand-based inundation treatments. All species showed preferences for stable conditions without inundation, along with slow water table decline for S. elaeagnos. Fast rates of water table decline were detrimental to all species. Overall, sand was a much more effective substrate than gravel for supporting cutting establishment. These results suggest that riparian restoration schemes utilizing S. elaeagnos cuttings may experience greater success than those using the other species investigated. P. nigra cuttings may establish more easily if situated where inundation does not occur often or for prolonged periods, and A. incana cuttings should be planted only; where very stable conditions dominate. The study highlights the inter-species variability in the survival and growth response of riparian trees to differing hydrological conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Water limited ecosystems such as savannas are characterized by strong interactions between water fluxes and vegetation. However, the fraction of mean annual rainfall that is transformed into plant available water, is not only dependent on the prevailing vegetation cover, but also on abiotic factors such as soil texture and topography as well as intra-annual precipitation patterns. Most models projecting savanna vegetation cover dynamics have not accounted for these factors until now. Here, it is highlighted how and why spatial heterogeneity in water availability and vegetation cover is closely related to abiotic conditions. The role of soil texture, slope and precipitation patterns on water availability and emergent vegetation patterns are systematically tested by using the process-based, spatially explicit model EcoHyD. The analysis shows that the same overall precipitation will result in qualitatively different vegetation cover, depending on environmental conditions. This highlights that models of savanna systems should indeed resolve water dynamics and the feedbacks between water and vegetation with care. In addition the study discusses that future savanna models should go one step further and include phenotypic plasticity and demographic processes to better resolve individual plant responses towards water stress.},

abstract = {Flooding and sediment deposition provide many benefits to riparian plants, including dispersal of propagules, new seedbeds for germination, and transient pulses of water and nutrients during early growth. Though many riparian species are adapted to flood disturbance, sediment deposition can also be a stressor to existing plants, limiting their survival and growth. Though many field studies document short-term changes in plant density immediately following floods, an outstanding question remains to what degree plants can survive and re-emerge following fluvial deposition events. We conducted two year-long studies to quantify the response of riparian trees to sediment deposition, testing a range of species, sizes and burial depths. One experiment focused on long-term survival following complete burial for seedlings and saplings of cottonwood (Populus fremontii), tamarisk (Tamarix ramosissima), and box elder (Acer negundo). A second experiment focused on cottonwood seedling response to more moderate deposition events, comparing survival and vigor (height, diameter growth, and leaf production) across a range of treatments from 10 to 50cm sediment depth. Complete burial killed all tamarisk and cottonwood plants; however all box elder survived and resprouted from the sediment surface in the following growing season. In the partial burial experiment, cottonwood survival was higher in the shallower deposition treatments and for larger plants across all treatments. Cottonwood seedlings with exposed stem length longer than ∼20cm were highly likely to survive ({\textgreater}90{\%}), whereas plant survival was severely reduced for stems with greater portions of their stems buried. Seedlings that survived partial burial experienced a positive, compensatory response in the following growing season, with height increment and canopy expansion proportional to the depth of sediment added. These results suggest that flood-borne sediment deposition events, either under natural or river management conditions, may have non-linear effects on the survival of existing riparian tree cohorts. The severity of the disturbance effects will depend on the magnitude of the event and the initial size of the plants. Together with field studies on riparian plant demography and experiments that test plants' vulnerability to flood disturbance, our study extends understanding of the drivers of plant mortality in fluvial corridors.},

abstract = {Progress in understanding and managing complex systems comprised of decision-making agents, such as cells, organisms, ecosystems or societies, is-like many scientific endeavours-limited by disciplinary boundaries. These boundaries, however, are moving and can actively be made porous or even disappear. To study this process, I advanced an original bibliometric approach based on network analysis to track and understand the development of the model-based science of agent-based complex systems (ACS). I analysed research citations between the two communities devoted to ACS research, namely agent-based (ABM) and individual-based modelling (IBM). Both terms refer to the same approach, yet the former is preferred in engineering and social sciences, while the latter prevails in natural sciences. This situation provided a unique case study for grasping how a new concept evolves distinctly across scientific domains and how to foster convergence into a universal scientific approach. The present analysis based on novel hetero-citation metrics revealed the historical development of ABM and IBM, confirmed their past disjointedness, and detected their progressive merger. The separation between these synonymous disciplines had silently opposed the free flow of knowledge among ACS practitioners and thereby hindered the transfer of methodological advances and the emergence of general systems theories. A surprisingly small number of key publications sparked the ongoing fusion between ABM and IBM research. Beside reviews raising awareness of broad-spectrum issues, generic protocols for model formulation and boundary-transcending inference strategies were critical means of science integration. Accessible broad-spectrum software similarly contributed to this change. From the modelling viewpoint, the discovery of the unification of ABM and IBM demonstrates that a wide variety of systems substantiate the premise of ACS research that microscale behaviours of agents and system-level dynamics are inseparably bound.},

abstract = {Improving our knowledge of regeneration processes in riparian woodlands could help guide restoration projects by enhancing the natural regeneration potential of riparian tree species. In western Europe, Populus nigra, is a major component of riparian woodlands, but the spatial extent of this species has decreased due to river management activities. In this study, the timing of Populus nigra seed dispersal and variations in seed germinability through time were monitored. An experiment was also devised to measure both seed germination and seedling survival in changing hydrologic conditions. The seed dispersal period lasted 12 weeks along the Garonne River. Individual poplar trees displayed variations in seed release patterns. On average, seed germinability remained rather low and close to 28{\%}. However, large differences in germinability were observed between trees and over time. A continuously wet substrate was the most favorable condition for germination and seedling survival. A change from wet to submerged conditions increased germination and reduced seedling survival. In the case of a change from either wet or submerged to dry conditions, there was no survival possible if the dry conditions persisted more than one week. Substrate type had a significant effect on germinability only in moderate moisture conditions. Populus nigra tolerates decreases in the optimum minimum flow if coupled with at least a brief rise in river level on a weekly basis.},

Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases.

Do differences in site conditions between various life stages of woody vegetation types need to be considered? Do interactions between hydrological factors influence distribution patterns? Location: Mid-reaches of the Elbe River, Germany. Methods: Young and old life stages of two different riparian Salix communities were surveyed in 1067 plots of 400 m(2) to determine hydrological growth conditions using habitat distribution models. Models were extrapolated in a Geographic Information System to quantify the extent of potential stands available for reforestation measures. Results: Average water level and water level fluctuations were related to different vegetation types as well as to the age classes of the vegetation types. Differences in hydrological niches of young and old vegetation of the two vegetation types (tree community versus shrub community) could be identified. Moreover, the shrub vegetation was influenced by the interaction of average water level and fluctuations. Comparison of the distribution of current vegetation and suitable habitat revealed that considerable areas of the floodplain were suitable for the reforestation of Salix woodland communities. Conclusions: Hydrological variables explain the distribution patterns of riparian Salix communities in the active floodplain when different life stages, vegetation types and interaction of variables are included in the analyses. This information can be used to recommend suitable sites for Salix plantings in riparian landscapes.},

abstract = {Aim and location In Central European lowlands certain plant species grow mainly or exclusively in the corridors of large rivers. In German-speaking plant geography, they are known as `Stromtalpflanzen'. The aim of this paper is to review the literature about definitions, explanations and species characteristics and to suggest future directions in research concerning this species group. Results A preliminary list contains 129 ecologically heterogeneous plant species. The mechanisms generating the peculiar distribution pattern may include hydrochory along river corridors, high levels of disturbance by water, variable water availability including inundation and summer drought, warm summers and high nutrient supply on alluvial soils. There is evidence from observational studies for all above mechanisms. However, none of them has been tested experimentally. Demographic data of river corridor plants are limited to very few species, including mainly invasive annuals (Artemisia annua, Bidens frondosa, Cuscuta campestris, Xanthium albinum) and annual (hemi)parasites (Cuscuta campestris, Melampyrum cristatum). Metapopulation studies do not exist to date for European species. Apart from their habitat requirements, river corridor plants were grouped according to their similarities in overall distribution pattern or their distribution within particular river corridors. Main conclusions River corridor plants include a high proportion of threatened plant species. In order to preserve them, and in order to understand the mechanisms generating the peculiar distribution pattern, much more has to be known about their population biology and metapopulation dynamics.},
