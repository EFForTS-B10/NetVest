	abstract = {In this article we investigate the factors affecting levels and growth of incomes in rural Indonesia following the crisis of 1997–1998. In particular, we investigate the relative roles of nonfarm incomes and productivity improvements achieved via changes in crops versus improvements on the same crops on income dynamics. Framing the article in the context of an optimal labor allocation model, relying on unique household panel data from Central Sulawesi, and using advanced panel econometric methods, we ﬁnd that local innovations related to the adoption and intensiﬁcation of new cash crop varieties, more speciﬁcally the shift from coffee to cocoa production, can explain a substantial part of the observed post-crisis developments. Causal estimates of the effect of growing cocoa suggest that households were on average able to achieve about 14\% higher income levels during the post-crisis period compared to the planting of other crops, most notably coffee. Also, our results demonstrate the importance of engagement in nonfarm activities for household income growth. Comparative analyses using a nationally representative survey suggest that similar processes are at play in other parts of Indonesia.},

	abstract = {High performance computing (HPC) clusters play a pivotal role in large-scale bioinformatics analysis and modeling. For the statistical computing language R, packages exist to enable a user to submit their analyses as jobs on HPC schedulers. However, these packages do not scale well to high numbers of tasks, and their processing overhead quickly becomes a prohibitive bottleneck.Here we present clustermq, an R package that can process analyses up to three orders of magnitude faster than previously published alternatives. We show this for investigating genomic associations of drug sensitivity in cancer cell lines, but it can be applied to any kind of parallelizable workflow.The package is available on CRAN and https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq. Code for performance testing is available at https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq-performance.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
