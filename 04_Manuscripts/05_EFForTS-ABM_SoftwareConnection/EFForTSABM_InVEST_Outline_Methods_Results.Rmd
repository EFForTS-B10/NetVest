# Methods

## Integration of InVEST with EFForTS-ABM 

To simultaneously simulate biodiversity and socio-economic functions within a single analysis we integrated EFForTS-ABM with the InVEST model. EFForTS-ABM generated the land-use and land-cover maps (LULC-maps), the impact-maps and the parameter settings used as inputs for InVEST. InVEST calculated the habitat quality for further processing within EFForTS-ABM *THIS SENTENCE IS UNCLEAR TO ME*. We developed functional and non-functional requirements for testing correct implementation. 
*Mention at first in intro or at first in methods?* *I suggest in the introduction as functional and non-functional requirements may need explanation especially if the target journal is more ecologically focused*

The static production function model InVEST-Terrestrial Biodiversity (Version 3.9, Tier 1) was used to simulate biodiversity [@kareiva_natural_2012]. The model is spatially-explicit and calculates a grid-cell level degradation score and a grid-cell level habitat-quality score for every grid cell which was assigned suitable habitat. Suitable habitat depends on the selected research objective (general biodiversity, species-specific needs). The degradation score depends on proximity of habitat-types to user-defined impacts to biodiversity. The calculation is based on (i) the distribution of land use and land cover (LULC-map) for the area of interest, (ii) the distribution and intensity of user-defined impacts to biodiversity (impact-maps), (iii) the assignment of suitable habitats and their sensitivity to impacts (sensitivity-table), and (iv) the relative impact weighting and how quickly the impact decays over space (impact-table). For a full description of the calculation see [@sharp_r_invest_nodate]. The degradation score is then standardized to a grid cell-level habitat quality score (Figure \@ref(fig:invest)) via a half-saturation function. Resulting in a degradation-map and a quality-map as inputs for EFForTS-ABM. The habitat-quality score is a proxy for biodiversity based on a simple habitat-analysis, enabling rapid assessment of biodiversity patterns. InVEST is scientifically grounded and is widely applied to simulate biodiversity and ecological functions based on spatially-explicit maps. A detailed user guide was published in @sharp_r_invest_nodate.

To simulate the socio-economic component of the analysis, the dynamic land-use change model, EFForTS-ABM (version xyz), was used. The initial landscapes for EFForTS-ABM are *Do you mean the initial landscapes are always generated from LGraf or only for this study. If only for this study reword to past tense i.e. are becomes were* generated with the landscape generator EFForTS-LGraf. Landscapes are comprised of regular grids of 100 x 100 cells, with each cell representing a 50 m x 50 m area creating a total landscape dimension of 25km^2^. These grids represent a forested landscape in Sumatra (Indonesia) with roads and villages of smallholder farming household agents and agricultural fields (oilpalm and rubber) owned and farmed by individual households. Every year households make rational land-use decisions with the aim to maximize their economic benefit (Figure\@ref(fig:abm) ). Detailed descriptions of EFForTS-LGraf and EFForTS-ABM were published in @salecker_efforts-lgraf_2019 and @dislich_land-use_2018, respectively. EFForTS-ABM is able to investigate how the decisions of smallholders affect economic functions (e.g. household consumption) and landscape structure from a local to a landscape scale and vice versa at various points in time. The ABM comprises a spatially-explicit landscape with assignment of land use (management) and land cover (oilpalm, rubber, forest, village) to each grid cell *sentence seems to be repeating information already provided*. The impacts to biodiversity (from either land use or land cover) can easily be derived from EFForTS-ABM. The ABM is also suitable to integrate the generated habitat quality maps from InVEST. Therefore, EFForTS-ABM fits the requirements to dynamically generate and process the inputs and outputs of InVEST.

knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/png/Economic_simple.png"))
```

<br>

The implementation of both models was achieved by an two-way Input-Output-Transfer. We mapped the outputs from EFForTS-ABM as the inputs for InVEST and mapped the outputs from InVEST as the inputs for EFForTS-ABM. First, EFForTS-ABM generates (i) the LULC-map and  (ii) one impact-map for each defined impact, (iii) the corresponding sensitivity-table and (iv) impact-table. The LULC-map and the impact-maps are in Tag Image File format (tif-format) and the sensitivity-table and impact-table are in comma-seperated value format (csv-format). Second, InVEST integrates the generated inputs of EFForTS-ABM and calculates the habitat-degradation map and habitat-quality map in tif-format for further processing in EFForTS-ABM (Figure\@ref(fig:transfer)). Since EFForTS-ABM is only able to process asc-format and InVEST is only able to process tif-format, asc- and tif-formats were converted by Geospatial Data Abtraction Library (Version xyz depending on InVEST-Version, @gdal).

<br>

```{r transfer, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "**Input-Output-Transfer between EFForTS-ABM and InVEST**. The input of InVEST (LULC-map, Impact-map, Sensitivity-table, Impact-table) are generated by EFForTS-ABM. The input of EFForTS-ABM (Habitat-Degradation-map, Habitat-Quality-map) are generated by InVEST. For the transfer a converter is needed."}

## Evaluation of integration of InVEST with EFForTS-ABM

To evaluate the integration between InVEST and EFForTS-ABM, we adopted a widely applied software testing system as our requirement plan [@bashar_requirements_2000]. This plan was divided into functional and non-functional requirements.

The functional requirements included a testing scheme beginning from unit-tests to integration-tests and ending with an acceptance-test [@a_contan_test_2018]. Unit-tests were applied to verify the correct implementation of processes. This was realized by an isolated unit-testing module within EFForTS-ABM. This module comprised each particular process implemented by the integration of InVEST with EfforTS-ABM. We compared the simulated output of each particular process to its expected output (Table A in Supplementary Materials). Integration-tests were applied to verify the correct integration between InVEST and EFForTS-ABM. This could be proven by correct Input-Output-Processing. It was realized by an isolated integration-testing module within EFForTS-ABM. For more convenient comparison of results, we chose a simplified parameter setting (see table 1 and table 2) - with binary approaches for all assignment of values (habitat, sensitivity, intensity of impacts, impact weighting) - and two simplified landscapes - forest-landscape and single-field-landscape. First, to verify the correct calculation of habitat-quality scores, the simulated grid cell-level habitat quality scores for the forest-landscape were compared to the expected output. Second, the simulated grid cell-level habitat-quality scores for the single-field-landscape were compared to the expected output to verify the correct reduction of habitat quality scores by the defined impacts.

<br>

```{r sensitivty table,echo=FALSE}
#Create dataframe from txt file
sensitivity <- read.table("tables\\sensitivitytable_integrationtest.txt", header = TRUE)
sens <- data.frame(sensitivity)

#Create table
pander::pander(sens, caption = 'Table 1: **Sensitivity table.** Classification (LULC) and names (NAMES) of LULC-types and their corresponding habitat assignment (HABITAT) and sensitivities to defined impacts (L_oilpalm, L_rubber). ')
```

<br>

```{r impact table,echo=FALSE}
#Create dataframe from txt file
impact <- read.table("tables\\impacttable_integrationtest.txt", header = TRUE)
imp <- data.frame(impact)

#Create table
pander::pander(imp, caption = 'Table 2: **Impact table.** Maximal distance of each impact over space (MAX_DIST in km), its corresponding impact weighting (WEIGHT) and how impacts decay over space (DECAY). ')
```

<br>

The acceptance-test was applied to verify the dynamic simulation of socio-economic functions and biodiversity simultaneously. This test represents a constant price scenario without learning and without any landmarket *May need to explain what a land market is (unless this is done in the intro first)*. The landscape was parameterized with data from a lowland rainforest transformation system in Sumatra, Indonesia. Parameter settings for InVEST are shown in tables 1 and 2. Parameter settings for EFForTS-ABM are shown in table 3. The household consumption of all households was analyzed as one representative for socio-economic-functions. The landscape-level habitat quality score, which is a aggregation of all grid cell-level habitat quality scores, was analyzed as the representative for biodiversity. Each test was executed with the R package nlrx (version xyz)[@salecker_nlrx_2019].

<br>

```{r Parameter setting EFForTS-ABM, echo=FALSE}
#Create dataframe
para_efforts <- data.frame(Parameters = c("Prices", "Learning", "Inefficiency", "which-map", "land-use-change-decision", "initial-wealth-distribution", "landmarket", "biodiv_plants", "biodiv_plants_objective"),
                 Value = c("constant prices", "no learning", "no inefficiency", "five-farmers2", "only-one-field-per-year", "constant", "no landmarket", "invest_pyhton", "general")
                 )

#Create table
pander::pander(para_efforts, caption = 'Table 3: **Parameter setting for EFForTS-ABM** (Maybe move to Supplementary Materials) ')
```

The non-functional requirements include the reproducibility of the integrated EFForTS-ABM-InVEST software tool. Simulations can be executed on a linux-server or on a high-performance-cluster with uniform software management, shared batch management environment, cross-system monitoring and accounting, and cross-system file systems. The simulations *Already mentioned use of nlrx to run simulations* were submitted to the high-performance-cluster using the R package clustermq (version xyz, @schubert_clustermq_2019). For the execution of the simulations on a server, we designed a repository on github. It includes setup instructions and a dockerfile with the correct version of InVEST and its required dependencies along with an R-Studio-Server for execution of simulations. For the execution of the simulations on a high-performance-cluster, we designed a singularity container, which duplicates the dockerfile into a singularityfile on the cluster. *Here, we have to wait for further progress. Actually, there is no function within cluster_mq to run a singularity container on the hpc. We opened an issue and wait for response. If there is no convenient way to run singularity on hpc, we have to work with an manual installation of InVEST on the cluster.*


# Results

## Integration of InVEST with EFForTS-ABM

The integration was achieved by extending EFForTS-ABM with the biodiversity submodel (Figure\@ref(fig:architecture)). First, the input for InVEST (i)-(iv) is generated within EFForTS-ABM. At initialization (1) the InVEST model - Terrestrial Biodiversity is set up and (2) depending on research objective (general biodiversity or species-specific needs) the sensitivity table and impact-table are generated. Every year the ABM (3) generates the LULC-map and the corresponding impact-maps which are (4) stored as tif-files after conversion. Second, the habitat quality is calculated within EFForTS-ABM. Every year the ABM (5) invokes InVEST and transfers the previous generated output (i)-(iv). Based on the transferred output (7) the model InVEST calculates the Habitat-Degradation map and Habitat-Quality map. Within EFForTS-ABM (8) the maps are converted and (9) the habitat-quality scores of the Habitat-Quality map are stored in the grid cells of the landscape of EFForTS-ABM as an additional landscape property. Finally, the ABM (10) aggregates the grid-cell level habitat-quality scores to (10) to a landscape-level habitat-quality score.

## Evaluation of integration of InVEST with EFForTS-ABM

We confirmed all evaluated functional requirements stated in our requirement plan for the correct integration of InVEST and EFForTS-ABM. The implementation of processes was verified, as the expected output of each particular process equaled its simulated output (Table 1, Supplementary Materials). The integration of both models was further verified by the correct calculation of habitat-quality and correct reduction of habitat-quality by impacts *Statement is not fully clear to me*. Within the forest-landscape all grid cells showed the highest possible habitat-quality score of 1. For the single-field-landscape, the habitat-quality score of the agricultural field showed the highest reduction of habitat-quality (value x). The neighboring forest grid cells in a radius of 50 m showed less reduction of habitat quality (value x). All other forest grid-cells showed no reduction of habitat-quality (Habitat-quality score = 1), as the greatest distance of all impacts is 50 m. The dynamic and simultaneous simulation of socio-economic functions and biodiversity was achieved. Our results showed the the yearly household consumption and yearly biodiversity (landscape-level habitat-quality score) over the simulated time within one single analysis (Figure 5). *The focus of this paragraph is not clear, are you focused on the integration being achieved or on the results produced by the integrated models*

The non-functional requirements for reproducibility were achieved by a docker-file and a singularity container. The docker-file can be accessed on our github repository [<https://github.com/nilsbeyer/rstudio-docker>]. *Also describe in detail the setup instruction and content of docker-file, which is listed in repository or is it enough to refer to repository?*

* Include ODD-protocol for models? I would say no, because the focus is not on the models itself, but more on the connection, its realisation and the benefit.
